301,"Actually Matt, it was the Japanese that posed the biggest threat to Australia during WWII, but your sentiments are still accurate - it was the US that ended the war and before that lost thousands of troops fighting the Japanese advance towards Australia.",43,TimOfAltona
302,"Wrong thread pal - if you scroll up you will see this is a story about Iraq, nothing to do with Ukraine. Perhaps it's time you stopped using Guardian threads as your own personal bulletin board? ",37,TimOfAltona
303,Good comment - unfortunately the Labor/Greens cheer squad blindly oppose anything and everything this government does - no matter how many lives may be saved - the last thing they want to see is this government being credited with saving lives through humanitarian action. ,45,TimOfAltona
304,"Tony Abbott has already been credited with saving hundreds, if not thousands of lives, through the successful 'stop the boats' policy (&amp; don't the Labor/Greens cheer squad just that outcome), so it follows he will assist the US with humanitarian food drops to stave off genocide in northern Iraq (again, don't the Labor/Greens cheer squad just hate the thought of that happening) and this will have the support of all  Australians who will be proud that Australia is doing all it practically can towards this most worthy of causes.",90,TimOfAltona
305,"Good to see the government pushing on with it's agenda. Not everything has gone to plan, but these things never do, particularly with the dogs breakfast of a senate, but there is plenty of time for the key policies to start delivering the reform we needed after 6 years of Labor/Greens mismanagement. ",53,TimOfAltona
306,The Labor/Greens cheer squad are conflicted - they attack Abbott for showing leadership on this issue (presumably concerned he will look good on the world stage) yet they stay strangely silent when Plibersek and Shorten echo Abbott's comments. Must be tough coming up with confected attacks day in day out.,50,TimOfAltona
307,Good to know that Longers was secretly listening in on the phone conversations between Putin and Abbott and can offer the PM some sound advice on how to conduct discussions between world leaders in the future.,36,TimOfAltona
308,"Don't despair - it's only the Labor/Greens cheer squad out for retribution for the severe flogging their party received at the last federal election (Lost dozens of seats). Their mission is to attack anything and everything the Australian PM says, hoping something will stick. ",45,TimOfAltona
309,"Fat chance, the Labor/Greens party are out of government in Australia for at least the next 8 years or so. Many of these people are just finding it hard to accept IMHO.",32,TimOfAltona
310,"I think you are right, there is definitely a pattern emerging here - never fear though - you have a strong ally in the Australian Labor/Greens/Putin cheer squad. They'll back you all the way against the Australian PM.",38,TimOfAltona
311,"No I disagree, NATO has some serious fire power behind it and can stop the Russian military - won't happen though because no-one wants a war with Russia. That said, I don't think Russia would have too many allies coming to it's rescue militarily.",44,TimOfAltona
312,Here's a useful tip though - I think you will find a fair few Labor/Greens cheer squad members supporting you as anyone Abbott criticizes is immediately befriended by the cheer squad as one of their own -it's just the way it goes.,42,TimOfAltona
313,Actually it's only in the minds of a minority group called the Labor/Greens cheer squad - the majority of Australian's support the government over this issue - perhaps it's time you did too.,33,TimOfAltona
314,Wrong comrade John - you clearly missed Plibersek's two bob's worth this morning backing the PM and Julie Bishop's comments and firing her own salvos (on behalf of Labor) in Putin's general direction. Do keep up.,36,TimOfAltona
315,I think the Australian PM speaks for most like-minded countries around the world - Russia has no place invading Ukrainian sovereign territory - naturally though Putin would not give a toss about what the rest of the world thinks - he will enter eastern Ukraine on a 'peace-keeping' mission to protect the Russian separatists from the Ukrainian government troops and the whole conflict escalates from there. The Ukraine military is no match for the might of Russia. ,78,TimOfAltona
316,"Your little contribution will certainly assist the tens of thousands on the verge of genocide in northern Iraq. Strange comment though - you applaud Obama's position, but condemn Abbott's support of Obama's position. ",34,TimOfAltona
317,"What is  view on thousands of men, women and children drowning at sea because people smugglers were given a product to sell by the Rudd Labor government?  ",30,TimOfAltona
318,What a bitter and twisted lot the Labor/Greens cheer squad are - here is Australia doing absolutely the right thing by assisting saving lives in Northern Iraq and all they want to do is attack the PM &amp; government for undertaking this humanitarian mission. ,45,TimOfAltona
319,"I somehow suspect that if Australia did nothing and people died as a result, the cheer squad would be the first to condemn/attack the government for allowing it to happen and it would all be Abbott's fault. ",38,TimOfAltona
320,"I guess their greatest fear is that the government may actually look good, which means they place their obsession with trying to make the PM look bad ahead of saving lives of the Yazidi folks on Mt Sinjar. ",39,TimOfAltona
321,It's pretty clear to everyone that Hockey was quoting evidence extracted from the ABS figures relating to motor vehicle ownership in disadvantaged areas.... this is fact whether people like it or not.  ,34,TimOfAltona
322,"Sure he could have phrased his argument better and sure he played into the hands of the usual anti-government minority groups, but facts are facts and shooting the messenger is the easy route that achieves little - the challenge is how to get the nation's finances back on track to sustain this country for future generations. ",57,TimOfAltona
323,Labor had their turn and were found seriously wanting - nothing they have said or done in opposition gives us any confidence that they can manage the nation's finances any better than they managed the leadership/factional dysfunction which tore the party apart during the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years - and continues today under Shorten. IMHO,53,TimOfAltona
324,"The Guardian is being just a little too cute - trying to conjure up a story that does not exist. Sure the Labor/Greens cheer squad will click on the headline and fire off the usual anti-government sentiments, but at the end of the day there is no story here - unless you want the story to be ""Australia will not send ground troops to Iraq"" or my personal favourite ""Australia will only commit to humanitarian assistance for Northern Iraq"" end of story.",82,TimOfAltona
325,Hang on - the photo was 'designed' by the boy's father and posted on twitter by the father - the government did not take the photo nor did they publish it - it was published by hundreds of media outlets world wide. ,43,TimOfAltona
326,Err¡­the government did not publish the picture - it was first on twitter from the father of the boy and then was published by dozens of media outlets around the globe.  ,33,TimOfAltona
327,Gotta laugh...this from the Labor/Greens cheer squad who blame Tony Abbott for everything ranging from earthquakes in Chile to Ebola virus outbreaks in Africa to Abbott's forebears starting Britains involvement in WW1.,32,TimOfAltona
328,I guess it's fair to say that the coalition had only been in government for 5 mins when this incident occurred and that Labor had just left government after 6 years to get it right - however responsibility lies with the minister of the day - expect to see fewer and fewer of these types of Immigration stuff ups occurring in the future as the coalition tighten up the regulations/procedures.,70,TimOfAltona
329,"If this had happened when Labor were in government, the Liberal opposition would have been all over this incident - so good to see Labor holding the government to account over this.",32,TimOfAltona
330,It's all starting to come together for the government - the objective is to close down the off shore processing centres starting up Rudd's flotilla of people smuggling boats again. ,31,TimOfAltona
331,"Cambodia is a good outcome and will go a long way to achieving what we voted for last year - stopping the boats, stopping the drownings and eventually closing down the processing centres.",33,TimOfAltona
332,"Labor/Greens supporters seem too be getting all hyper over poll results - here's a tip - the election is over 2 years away. If you think a day is a long time in politics, two years is a generation.  ",41,TimOfAltona
333,Your energy is best directed towards trying to rebuild a shattered ALP and trying to get them into a competitive position to be a viable alternative government in 2019 or perhaps 2022. IMHO.,33,TimOfAltona
334,"I have said for a while now that the polls will swing back towards the government over the coming months¡­..the Labor/Green honeymoon period will end as people recognise that Labor's rebuilding is only just beginning, and the Greens are, well, the Greens. ",43,TimOfAltona
335,"I'm confused - so Murdoch's polls are rigged - when they show Labor in a commanding lead, which they have for a while now, those are also rigged? Or is it when they show Labor as leading they are accurate, but rigged when they show the Liberals in front? ",50,TimOfAltona
336,Good to see Chuck in town. When push comes to shove it will be the Americans we turn to for assistance and it is the Americans who will be first to our side to assist. ,36,TimOfAltona
337,Good to see another problem inherited from the dysfunctional Labor years being sorted out by the new government. Julie Bishop is clearly growing in stature in her role as Australia's Foreign Minister - all good.,35,TimOfAltona
338,"I think Napthine will be returned - Labor are simply too risky to be trusted with the Treasury keys - there have been some shocking Labor governments in Victoria over the years - Cain, Kirner, Bracks and we are still paying for their incompetence in our rates and taxes. ",50,TimOfAltona
339,Andrews has given us no comfort that he is a future premier nor can lead a viable alternative government. In fact there are very big questions over his bona fides - particularly where his links to the CFMEU are concerned. ,41,TimOfAltona
340,Always good to hear from the left wing minority in Australia who were crushed at the last federal election - now back to what the majority of Australians' think - here's a tip - the Scottish referendum does not rate highly on our radar - if at all!,48,TimOfAltona
341,Joe Hockey is actually a good bloke and a decent Australian - yes he said a dumb thing and has made himself an easy target for the haters - but ultimately he wants to position the country for future prosperity. ,41,TimOfAltona
342,"Labor supporters don't like it because they don't want Hockey to succeed where Labor failed, a bit like Morrison and the illegal people smuggler boats where Labor were found to be hopelessly inadequate, but ultimately Hockey will prevail and get key parts of his budget through.",46,TimOfAltona
343,Perhaps the answer is we just go down the path of the US and rack up trillions of dollars in national debt and just hope it all works out for future generations - sounds like this is the Labor/Greens way.,40,TimOfAltona
344,"The dilemma here is that if people smugglers believed that children of asylum seekers would be given 'special' treatment by Australian authorities ie: released immediately into the community and perhaps their parents allowed to join them later then standby for an armada boats laden with children departing Indonesia....how many young lives would be lost along the way, 50, 100, 500, 1000? ",62,TimOfAltona
345,"How many young lives lost does Sarah HY think is an acceptable number to sacrifice if it means that some can reach Australia safely by boat - 50, 100, 500, 1000? ",32,TimOfAltona
346,I have yet to hear one rational answer from the Labor/Greens cheer squad - how many lives lost is acceptable if Australia opens it's borders to people arriving via people smuggler boats? ,33,TimOfAltona
347,"Very easy for a failed former Treasurer to fire salvos at his political nemeses from the peanut gallery and be warmly embraced by the 'true believers' down at trades hall, but reality is Wayne you had your turn and things did not turn out so well for you, the ALP or the country. ",54,TimOfAltona
348,"Given that Labor and the Greens feed off each other for political relevance and Labor are pretty much dependant on the Greens for survival (who can forget that nauseating Julia Gillard/Bob Brown love fest) they may as well merge and be called ""Green Labor""",44,TimOfAltona
349,"Does not say if the Australian model is diesel, petrol or gas¡­that aside, these are easily the best everyday taxis in the world¡­I've used them a fair bit in London and can't fault them for comfort and space.",38,TimOfAltona
350,"None of us here today, that includes PM Tony Abbott for those who were not aware, had anything to do with events that are reported to have occurred in the 1800's in Australia ( or anywhere else for that matter). ",41,TimOfAltona
351,Trying to link the comments made by the PM on barbaric events happening right now to historical events 200 years ago is pushing the anti-Abbott barrow a little too far in my opinion. ,34,TimOfAltona
352,"I could be wrong, but I seriously doubt that Tony Abbott had much to do with the reported slaughter of indigenous people 200 years ago -- even the most hardened Labor/Greens cheer squadder would have some degree of difficulty in linking the current PM with those events nor would  expect the current Australian PM to start discussing events of 200 years ago when providing regular updates on terrorist events and what the government is doing to mitigate the risk to Australians at home and overseas.  ",88,TimOfAltona
353,FDOM could have easily omitted panel 5 of the cartoon and the same point would have been made without turning it into the usual feeding session for the usual anti-Abbott brigade in these threads - completely unnecessary. ,38,TimOfAltona
354,PS - the final panel is incorrect - there  a memorial and heritage listing for the Myall Creek Massacre (followed up by a reconciliation ceremony between descendants of both the people murdered and the perpetrators) and there has been widespread acknowledgment/recognition of the horrific treatment of Aboriginal people at the hands of white settlers in the early days of colonisation.,61,TimOfAltona
355,"Oh dear - Labor supporters flock to this story because Murdoch did not back their team last year. In fact not only did Murdoch newspapers not back the Labor/Greens team, they had the  to report on the rampant dysfunction going on inside the Labor/Greens government. ",47,TimOfAltona
356,"The funny side of this is that the Labor supporters all looked the other way when their party was in melt down and chose to 'shoot the messenger ' instead, pointing the finger of blame for Labor's civil war on the newspapers reporting it. ",45,TimOfAltona
357,How funny would it be if Murdoch decided to back a Labor/Greens government in 2016. All these threads would either be empty of comment or would be praising Murdoch for his magnificent contribution to the Labor cause...I can hear the chorus of 'a great Australian' ringing out across the lefty blogosphere. ,52,TimOfAltona
358,I see a little 'home movie' of Julia Gillard's last night in the Lodge was leaked the other day - there's Julia with a suspiciously outrageously expensive glass of Grange in her mitt whilst leaning up against the balustrade for support whilst listening to the intoxicated drones of Wayne Swan's commiserations on the death of the Gillard government at the hands of the evil Rudd. ,66,TimOfAltona
359,"If it was revealed that the Prime Ministerial wine cellar had a cache of expensive wines, all the left wing commentators on here would be up in arms attacking the government for extravagance and waste at the expense of the poor, yet the story reveals the opposite, the PM, or his department, has been vigilant and it seems frugal with the tax payer funded wine cellar. ",67,TimOfAltona
360,Shhhhhh...don't mention that to the Labor/Greens cheer squad... they have duped themselves into thinking that a Labor/Greens government will just flop over the line in 2016 without doing or saying anything...albeit releasing a couple of policies at around 5pm the night before the polling day.,45,TimOfAltona
361,Nice try by the Labor/Greens cheer squad trying to link Palmer's comments to the Abbott government - falls on deaf ears though - Palmer is clearly 'out there' at the moment and is buddying up to Labor to try and block Budget elements in the senate. ,47,TimOfAltona
362,"You intentionally omitted that the Port of Newcastle has been leased to a , of which China Merchants Group is a member. Hastings Equity is also part of the leasing consortium - an Australian ASX listed company. ",38,TimOfAltona
363,Liberal governments  the nation's wealth then Labor governments come in and  all the nations wealth and place the country in tens of billions of dollars worth of debt and then Liberal governments return to fix up the debt mess and once again  the nations wealth then Labor come back in and spend......well you get the idea. It's been going on for decades.,65,TimOfAltona
364,"Interesting situation in Victoria - Labor have no real shadow front bench to speak of, a leader who nobody can even remember his name, a handful of policies (that no one can remember either) that did nothing except spend all the money that the Napthine government has built up in the bank account and they think that all they have to do is  to claim victory. ",68,TimOfAltona
365,Let's hope Victorians remember the dark days under Labor and also see that this current bunch of ALP pretenders have absolutely nothing going for them other than they fill up the spaces on the opposition benches. ,37,TimOfAltona
366,"If you want a reminder- just open up your water bill and enjoy the high cost due to Labor's multi-billion dollar desal plant white elephant, inactive and costing us hundreds of millions of dollars a year to sit there dormant.",40,TimOfAltona
367,Good to see Shorten channelling that great conservative PM Winston Churchill to make his point. Not sure the folks down at Trades Hall would be too impressed.Where is a quote from Karl Marx when you need one Bill?,38,TimOfAltona
368,I agree - what the alternative government think about these things is completely irrelevant - we have zero interest in knowing about what they may do if they were in government.,31,TimOfAltona
369,"Innocent men,women and children are being slaughtered day by day - no one is making that up. Google what these IS bastards are doing to children, including the photos, and  can argue against military intervention. The sooner the US and the UK and perhaps Australia step in the better.",50,TimOfAltona
370,"Agreed, however getting involved in a war that stops the IS advance through Iraq, Syria and is butchering and wiping out ethnic/religious minority communities who stand in their way is  a good result? ",35,TimOfAltona
371,"Mock the little yellow lifeboats if you must - but hey, they formed part of a policy that has seen zero reported drownings in the past few months vs 1000+ deaths at sea during the Labor/Greens administration. ",38,TimOfAltona
372,All countries in the world operate immigration detention/processing centers where people are detained  while their claims or bona fides are investigated and dealt with - Nauru and Manus are an extension of Australia's network of onshore/offshore detention centers established to handle the burden of thousands of people arriving by boats during the previous 6 years of Labor government. ,60,TimOfAltona
373,"Prisons are places where people are held either following  or have been charged with a crime and are held if it is deemed they are a danger to other people, themselves or are a flight risk. ",38,TimOfAltona
374,"You are correct Jim, western military intervention is not a long term solution - it is a band aid - but if it means in the short term saving perhaps tens or hundreds of thousands of people from a horrific death at the hands of IS it is definitely worth going for. ",53,TimOfAltona
375,"I hear your point, but I doubt IS fighters have much interest on who is the PM or which political party is in power in Australia while they go about their jihad - this same situation could have easily arisen when Labor were in government and Labor would be grappling with the same conundrum.  ",56,TimOfAltona
376,I think we all saw Gillian Triggs over-reach with some of her comments made to the Minister on Friday - prisons and armed guards. It was unfortunate because it was echoing a Sarah Hanson-Young type of rhetoric which tends to fall on deaf ears with the majority of the electorate. ,51,TimOfAltona
377,Triggs would have been better to stick with the facts without resorting to inaccurate or misleading statements (perhaps she genuinely believed the processing centre staff carried guns?) but as Chair she should have better informed herself. ,37,TimOfAltona
378,"wants to see Australia militarily involved in another war in the Middle East, however at some point we have to ask the question - do we stand by and look the other way knowing full well that daily massacres and ethnic cleansing is being perpetrated upon minority groups in Syria and Iraq by IS terrorists or do we do what we can, within our relatively limited capabilities militarily, to try and stop the genocide along with our US and UK partners? ",82,TimOfAltona
379,"Many will say we should stay out, none of our business as it's all happening on the other side of the world but the reality is that IS represent a global threat by the very nature of what they are trying to achieve and the means they use to destroy anyone standing in their way . ",57,TimOfAltona
380,I think the reality is that most of this budget will get through - sure there will be some tweeking to appease PUP and the independents and one or two cost saving measures may be diluted but it will go through and we can all move on. ,48,TimOfAltona
381,"I think the reality is also that Labor have been very uninspiring and highly unconvincing in their arguments against the budget - apart from promising to increase spending, axe the proposed savings and (by definition) create billions of dollars in additional debt if they were in government, we have seen little or nothing from them on how they would fix up their mess of the past 6 years. ",69,TimOfAltona
382,"There have been heat waves, droughts and massive bush fires recorded over the last 200 years in Australia, many worse than any we have seen in the last 40 or so years. ",33,TimOfAltona
383,I suspect that the same has been happening for the past 2000 years as well - going on about last year's temperatures as proof of global warming has zero credibility. JS.,31,TimOfAltona
384,Why do the Labor/Greens cheer squad always resort to childish name calling - to me it looks like they have lost the argument &amp; have nothing left but the antics you see more commonly in primary school children. This gives me great comfort that the Labor/Greens party will occupy the opposition benches for many years to come. IMHO.,58,TimOfAltona
385,The point I make is that there is a world of difference between armed and non-armed guards - particularly in these facilities. Triggs was wrong to assert that there are armed guards in the detention centres - there are not and never have been. Facts are facts.,47,TimOfAltona
386,"There is an element of accuracy to Morrison's statements about Labor's failed policies leading to thousands of people trying to make their way to Australia, including children, on people smuggling boats.  ",33,TimOfAltona
387,"He was also correct that the current Coalition policies will eventually lead to zero children being held in detention - why? - because the boats have stopped, people have stopped drowning and no more children are arriving by sea.",39,TimOfAltona
388,It's pretty clear to all that the opposition have been fairly provocative when it comes to abusing stand orders to the point some are actively baiting the Speaker seeking ejection - bit of a sport for Labor and one they can easily participate in given their seriously low numbers in the House of Reps - any voting is a forgone conclusion.,61,TimOfAltona
389,"Bandt should pull his head in. There is no legislative requirement for any PM, Labor or Liberal to debate committing of armed forces to foreign conflict in parliament and Bandt knows this. he is purely mischief making. ",38,TimOfAltona
390,Why the hell do we want to hear the Greens get up and say this whole mess can resolved by all sides joining hands and banging out a few lines of Kumbaya.,32,TimOfAltona
391,Plibersek is clearly out of her depth with this portfolio and Bill should be looking at a more competent person on his front bench to run with this shadow portfolio. ,31,TimOfAltona
392,"Labor mucked up the whole NBN roll out - cost blown out by billions of dollars, poorly implemented roll out and ridden with flaws and mismanagement. Ask Albo - he kept the reports hidden from us in the lead up to last years election. ",45,TimOfAltona
393,I can see where Malcolm Turnbull is coming from with his video explanation - I too often have to dumb things down to the Labor/Greens supporters to assist their comprehension of simple facts.,33,TimOfAltona
394,"Best ask the Dutch, they are heading the investigation aided by Malaysia. Abbott and Bishop's role was to bring home as many Australian victims as possible to their families- this is starting to occur as remains are positively identified by the team in Holland.",44,TimOfAltona
395,What a load of crap Daisy..... so by engaging with Muslim leaders to keep dialogue open Abbott is somehow alienating young men.....if we was ignoring Muslim communities you would be the first one on here attacking him for alienating the Muslim communities. ,43,TimOfAltona
396,These laws are targeting people who may be radicalised in Australia then going overseas to join jihads or some other terrorist cause and then returning to Australia where they represent an unacceptable risk to the Australian community. ,38,TimOfAltona
397,The Labor/Greens cheer squad need to take a deep breath and read what the PM is saying - we are not targeting Muslim groups - we are targeting terrorists irrespective of which religion or ethnicity they belong to. ,39,TimOfAltona
398,"Just so happens that right now 99.9999% of the IS jihadists rampaging through Iraq and Syria are Sunni Muslims or those who have converted to Sunni Islam and Sharia law, so it makes pretty good sense to have dialogue with the various Muslim groups represented in Australia. ",48,TimOfAltona
399,"Jim, I don't see too many Christians, Jews or Calathumpians rampaging through Iraq right now intent on wiping out minority ethic and religious communities like the Yazidis, Assyrians and Shabaks. ",31,TimOfAltona
400,To all the Labor/Greens cheer squad banging on about a DD - it will not happen so stop the constant droning on about the impossible - better you direct your energy to how Labor can recover and get themselves into a winning position over the next couple of terms or so - here's a tip - try and do it without depending on the Greens to get you across the line¡­.that always leads to disaster for all concerned.,78,TimOfAltona
401,"Here's a tip boys and girls - Labor is not a perfect political party by any means - they have many weaknesses, many associated with their reliance on unions and the Greens to keep them afloat.",36,TimOfAltona
402,That may be some warped &amp; twisted Labor/Greens solution to Israel protecting it's citizens from daily Hamas rocket attacks but it is not the solution the majority of Australians would support. ,32,TimOfAltona
403,Time the Labor/Greens cheer squad started to back this government on it's handling/response to the ISIS butchery instead of worrying about how good the PM may look as a result of our response.,33,TimOfAltona
404,"I doubt any decent Australians would want us to standby on the sidelines and do nothing whilst thousands of men,women and children from ethnic and minority communities are slaughtered under our noses.",32,TimOfAltona
405,The Labor/Greens party supporters appear oblivious to the daily genocide of minority religious and ethnic groups in Iraq - men women and children being butchered as ISIS cuts a swarth through Iraq and Syria. ,35,TimOfAltona
406,"While the majority of Australians are happy to see this country lend a hand to stop both the ISIS advance and the protection of minority communities, it seems the Labor/Greens cheer squad's primary area of concern ahead of the slaughter in Iraq is that the Abbott government may actually look good for helping prevent genocide and how many votes that may translate to in late 2016.",66,TimOfAltona
407,Funny how Abbott and Shorten are essentially saying the same things in relation to this humanitarian disaster but the Labor/Greens cheer squad focus their attack on Abbott but completely ignore Shorten's almost identical comments - it's as if Shorten does not even exist any more or is completely irrelevant in this discourse - I pick the latter.,57,TimOfAltona
408,"Well I guess if were not for the British we could could just as easily have been writing this thread today in Spanish, French or Portuguese - take your pick.",30,TimOfAltona
409,Again I am somewhat confused - Andrews was being attacked and vilified by the Labor/Greens cheer squad for attending the conference and now that he has announced he is not attending he is being attacked and called a coward for  attending? ,43,TimOfAltona
410,"Not sure why this is even a news story? People get sick all the time and the odds are someone will get sick up in Manus and will receive treatment accordingly, as is the case here. ",37,TimOfAltona
411,"Whilst I don't disagree that Australia should do what it can within our comparatively limited air power capability - there are other European military powers much closer to Iraq than Australia - where are the airforces of Germany, France, Italy or even Israel who could all lend significant fire power to any allied air strike against ISIS?

414,Part of Joyce's problem is that he came from a low cost airline background firstly in Europe and then Jetstar. I just don't think he transitioned well into the full service environment that was QF. He may have been better to remain heading up Jetstar and reporting into the QF CEO.,51,TimOfAltona
415,I travel fairly regularly overseas and have got to say that overall the Middle Eastern (Emirates and Etihad) and some of the Asian airlines (SQ &amp; CX in particular) are streets ahead of QF when it comes to product and service delivery. ,43,TimOfAltona
416,Qantas used to be on par with the big global airlines but have definitely dropped a few notches over the past 10 years - I think it's a mix of bad management and complacency. I would rate the attitude of QF cabin crew on par with that of the larger US airlines - which means it just ain't that good. ,61,TimOfAltona
417,Tony Sheldon is spot on when he says that Qantas need to change their CEO if they want to recover from this. Joyce has been a failure through and through and the QF Board (who recruited Joyce over Borghetti) are also to blame for this result.,46,TimOfAltona
418,Good to see Julie Bishop has finally tidied up the actions of the former Labor government spying debacle. Looks like relations with Indonesia have never been better¡­and getting stronger. ,30,TimOfAltona
419,What you fail to grasp is that ISIS are rampaging through Irag and Syria wiping out minority communities as they go - if you think that is an acceptable situation then that's fine but most decent people would rather the west step in and prevent genocide occurring under our noses - this where the US &amp; the UK with some assistance from Australia and other allies step in. ,69,TimOfAltona
420,Reality is most Australians support Abbott and the government's actions in assisting stopping the genocide of minority communities in Nthn Iraq. Labor have backed the government which is a good thing.,31,TimOfAltona
421,"To everyone on here commenting that the RC was a waste of time and money and achieved nothing, place yourselves in the shoes of the parents' who lost their young children as a direct result of this ill concieved/implemented roll out. ",42,TimOfAltona
422,"Agreed Daisy - the Iraqi government have to get their house in order if ISIS are to be defeated¡­this means equal representation from Sunnis and Shia, even a power sharing arrangement may be the solution..",35,TimOfAltona
423,I fail to see why there would be the need for a debate? Labor and the government are as one on this particular issue - they would be standing to support each other.,33,TimOfAltona
424,They know what they do is controversial and also that there are millions of Australians who do not agree with them so resorting to name calling to sustain their argument is a strong indicator of the weakness or even failure of their overall proposition.  ,46,TimOfAltona
425,"My personal view is these activists, whether they hail from Labor or the Greens would best put their energies into rebuilding their party so they can eventually form a viable alternative government down the track. ",36,TimOfAltona
426,Hang on - there two are not even part of Pussy Riot - they were ejected from the group for going off on their own personal crusade for prisoners rights in Russia. ,33,TimOfAltona
427,"Not sure why the Guardian want to give this small gathering so much publicity - if it's click bait for the Labor/Greens cheer squad then I guess they have succeeded, but reality is this World Congress for Families is a minority group holding views that are not shared by mainstream Australians. ",52,TimOfAltona
428,"As a Head of State, Putin requires no visa to come to Australia - in fact it is not even up to Australia as host nation to make the call on whether he attends or not - it is a collective decision by G20 members - Australia will abide by the consensus. ",53,TimOfAltona
429,"For those who are asking ""Shorten ?"" - he is the guy many commentators in this thread believe  be the PM but quickly ignore or look the other away when questions are asked about Shorten's performance, or for that matter the rest of the Labor front bench, for fear the rest of Australia can see what is the bleedin' obvious.",61,TimOfAltona
430,"Well if it is Abbott's war - then it surely is Shorten's war as well. The leader of your party has been backing the PM all the way on everything that has been said and done by Abbott in relation to Iraq, Syria and The Ukraine.",46,TimOfAltona

433,"Now that the govt has successfully shut down the people smugglers operation, the sooner these detainees are processed the sooner Manus and Nauru will be closed down - hopefully for good. ",32,TimOfAltona
434,Labor must bear some of the responsibility. They knew in their heart of hearts the mining tax was useless but hung onto it like some twisted ideological icon from the failed Gillard/Swan years - perhaps they did it so as not to upset Swanny.  ,46,TimOfAltona
435,"I think it sad that so many commentators in this thread seem to be more concerned about about the likely lift in the PM's approval rating following his decision to assist in Iraq, than they do about the thousands of men,women and children being slaughtered by ISIS.",47,TimOfAltona

438,Daniels is a buffoon of the highest order -he will say or do anything to try and cobble together a Labor victory - cheered on by the CFMEU who will be bank rolling his election campaign. ,37,TimOfAltona
439,Napthine has a fairly impressive list of achievements to support his claim to another term. This is the only state presiding over a budget surplus (despite Labor's disasterous white elephant desal plant) and this fact alone should be enough to get the Libs across the line. Labor is just too risky.,51,TimOfAltona
440,It's another pre-election promise made by Abbott and like so many others is being delivered upon. Alot of people are interested in getting to the truth over this matter - significant public interest and it's not over yet for Gillard by a long shot despite what Lenore says.,48,TimOfAltona
441,"Last time I looked she was replaced by a fellow called Kevin Rudd - some may call Rudd a squalid piece of work, but then again he did at least manage to save some of the furniture.",37,TimOfAltona
442,"Agreed, plenty of others have sunk the metaphorical knife into Gillard's back well before him, people like Kevin Rudd, Bill Shorten and Sam Dastyari - no room for any more.",30,TimOfAltona
443,I find it either amusing or sad that so many people are coming out tonight to barrack for the very person who came so close to wiping out the very party they espouse to be in government. ,38,TimOfAltona
444,"Consider this - had Gillard not been turfed out by the ALP, Labor would have been lucky to muster 30 seats last September - yet everyone on here proclaim Gillard to be some kind of Labor party messiah, not the Labor party destroyer she in reality was. ",48,TimOfAltona
445,Gillard may have been a very personable individual - but she was the most loathed PM Labor have ever experimented with - she was on track to nearly wipe out her own party at the election had she not been taken down by Shorten and thrown out of office. ,50,TimOfAltona
446,Unlikely - they will continue to thrash around in the political wilderness searching for purpose and leadership for the next few years....of course they will at some point regain government in this country but that time is a long way off...perhaps another 3 terms or more. How many leaders do you think they will churn through until they come up with a winner? ,64,TimOfAltona
447,Fair to say Morrison has done a great job in his portfolio. Stopping the boats and saving perhaps 1000+ lives along the way. Australians acknowledge and congratulate that achievement. ,30,TimOfAltona
448,"The left don't like it because it was a key plank in a raft of policies that contributed to the Labor/Greens loss last September and while the Labor/Greens cheer squad hoped like crazy the boats would keep arriving, Morrison and Operation Sovereign Borders has prevailed and shut down the people smuggling operation which was running rampant under the previous Labor/Greens government. ",62,TimOfAltona
449,"Just like the grubby Craig Thomson debacle, it quickly all turned to tears for all concerned and Gillard went on to be knifed by her own party such was her abject unpopularity. ",33,TimOfAltona
450,"No question, Gillard and Labor brought this all upon themselves by rushing in an individual with a 'colourful' past to try and stave off the inevitable thrashing at the polls.",30,TimOfAltona
451,The transition from a dysfunctional Labor/Greens government renowned for its massive overseas borrowing and escalating debt to a government intent on fixing up Australia's out of control fiscal mess was never going to be an easy task - tough and unpopular decisions had to be made and they were. ,50,TimOfAltona
452,"There was always going to be some pain and political capital burnt in the first 12 months, not assisted by a recalcitrant ALP/Greens party with nothing left in their locker except to block reform where they could in the senate with no plan of their own on how to fix &amp; strengthen Australia's economy. ",55,TimOfAltona
453,In year 2 the government should start to get the clear air they need to implement the reform and in year 3 hopefully the benefits will be evident for all to see. ,33,TimOfAltona
454,"The other key issue the government has to deal with is the uncertainty surrounding unfolding global events - Russia/Ukraine &amp; the deadly ISIS jihad will be around for years to come and who knows how many significant challenges/incidents the government will be expected to deal with in coming months - so far the government has had plenty of praise here and overseas for it's handling of both the twin MH disasters and the humanitarian response thus far in Nthn Iraq all of which, to their credit, Labor have backed and congratulated the government on. ",95,TimOfAltona
455,Labor are still years away from rebuilding their shattered party and still quite a way to go to sort out their leadership problems and the ongoing civil war between the left and right of the party. They also need to work out a way they can rebuild and move forward without having to rely on their Greens partners to get them over the line. There will need to be at least another two changes of leadership in Labor and Milne will have to also be gone from the Greens before Labor look anything like an alternative government. IMHO.,98,TimOfAltona
456,I think he is correct in that he and his government could have handled some domestic issues better - but no one expects any government to come into office on a landslide and have a blemish free first year - complicated by the dogs breakfast that is the current senate.  ,52,TimOfAltona
457,If you mean Chris Bowen - yes he is quite a good performer for Labor but also carries a fair bit of baggage from the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd debacles. Albo was about the only one that emerged from that period reasonably unscathed. ,41,TimOfAltona
458,Loyal????? Was not he the one that stuck the knife in the back of your revered Julia Gillard and tossed her out of the leadership like a piece of rubbish?  ,32,TimOfAltona
459,"Jai, they say a week is a long time in politics - everything can change over a couple of days - two years is an eternity - my prediction is once the budget fiasco is done and dusted (getting close now) the government will have clear air to deliver substantial reform and the opinion polls will start trending the other way. The indicators are there now. ",67,TimOfAltona
460,You've got to be kidding - she only got her passport when she found out she was being drafted into that that gig. Plibersek has well and truly got her 'L' plates on - learning on the job as they say. ,42,TimOfAltona
461,She has also been referring to the AFP as the ADF when discussing the MH17 disaster - a basic lesson in how to differentiate between the Federal Police and the Defence Force perhaps?,33,TimOfAltona
462,"Backed all the way by the man you have been spruiking to be the next PM...so please explain...how is this terrible if TonyAbbott does this, yet a good thing if Bill Shorten says/does the exact same thing? ",38,TimOfAltona
463,Clearly your greatest fear is the inevitable cudos Abbott will receive for acting decisively on this matter (supported by the fellow you are just aching to see as the next PM) so you take the side of ISIS in the hope they prevail and Abbott fails. ,47,TimOfAltona
464,If this is  wrong - how come the party you want to win the next election is giving it their full support - ie : the ALP would be taking the same action if they were in govt?,39,TimOfAltona
465,"Australians will back this decision by the government with the full backing of Labor - ISIS must be stopped and it will take a coalition of forces, including from the arab world, to halt the murderous ISIS rampage. ",39,TimOfAltona
466,"Well Laura, you have discussed an issue that has been around for thousands of years - this is not a new phenomenon - human males are naturally more aggressive and capable of murder than human females. ",37,TimOfAltona
467,Significantly more males are killed by other males each year than women - what would it be 4 to 1? - let's now have your article on why men kill other men in such large numbers. ,37,TimOfAltona
468,To those in this thread clearly more fearful of a boost in government approval ratings than they are of a domestic terrorist attack I say this - time to assess the sheer vacuousness of some of your comments and reflect on just what a terrorist attack on Australian soil represents and the damage and destruction it would cause.,58,TimOfAltona
469,I reckon an actual bomb going off or some kind of actual terror attack would do a lot more damage to our tourism industry than any preventative measures which are employed and often much stronger in the countries most of our visiting tourists come from.,45,TimOfAltona
470,"The UK have a 4 tier threat level system - the highest is 'Critical' meaning a terrorist attack is imminent and they have employed this level twice, once in 2006 and the other in 2007. ",36,TimOfAltona
471,What are the chances that if something terrible happens you &amp; the other Labor/Greens cheer squad will be the first on here accusing the government of not doing enough to protect us or prevent the attack. ,37,TimOfAltona
472,Strange how the left want to look the other way and pretend that there are no threats of terrorism - until something happens and then they demand to know why the government did not do more to protect us. ,40,TimOfAltona
473,The faceless men will keep Shorten in the job until after the next election when they will replace him with Albo to take the fight up to an energised Coalition entering their second term.,34,TimOfAltona
474,I find it bizarre that so many people are more concerned about the prospect of a rise in the PM's popularity than they are about the genocide of hundreds of thousands of people living in minority communities in Nthn Iraq and Syria.,42,TimOfAltona
475,"You somehow ignore the fact that  Supreme Leader, Bill Shorten, has backed this government all the way with it's handling and actions relating to the ISIS threat here and overseas. ",32,TimOfAltona
476,This is a strange one by the government - I think they picked on the wrong group of Australians here to look for cost savings. I'd like to see proper (original) indexation reinstated for the veterans. ,37,TimOfAltona
477,The aim is to assist the Iraqi army and Peshmerga fighters who  the troops on the ground take back ground lost and drive ISIS back to their base in Syria - containment. ,34,TimOfAltona
478,"Time to give up on confected outrage about the budget - the two issues are completely separate - the budget, with some tweaking, will soon be passed through with the help of PUP and then we can all move on. ",41,TimOfAltona
479,Last we looked he is running the country beautifully. He is doing the things you expect of an Australian PM. Seeing troops off to the Middle East is entirely in keeping with a PM's role - even Billy boy would manage to get along for that one if he were PM. ,52,TimOfAltona
480,"The kidnap victims for whom ransoms are paid are usually released - the ones for whom no ransoms are paid end up on You Tube videos in the desert wearing orange jump suits. The latter are equally valuable, if not more valuable, to the ISIS campaign.",46,TimOfAltona
481,I say that more than enough money has been thrown at this issue with mixed results - time for indigenous communities to take responsibility for their own actions - just like everyone else in Australia is required to do.,39,TimOfAltona
482,"Successive governments, Labor, Liberal, state and federal have collectively poured  of dollars of 'funding' into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities - building houses, schools, community centres, recreation facilities, drug and alcohol abuse programs, anti-sexual assault programs, homelessness support, adult education/training and employment programs - all designed to support and assist these Australian communities in rural and urban areas. ",61,TimOfAltona
483,It's an old cliche I know but the old adage that the people smugglers never had a better friend than in the Australian Greens who will provide them with a viable business model if they ever got into government or took control again of Labor policies.,46,TimOfAltona
484,"The pro-illegal people smuggling boats brigade of Sarah Hanson-Young,Christine Milne and the Labor supporters who just hate the Abbott government's success with Stopping the Boats should read this link instead of ignoring it or pretending this tragedy did not occur - ",42,TimOfAltona
485,...then come back to us and tell us once again how encouraging people to get on people smuggling boats is the right thing to do and how the government has got it all wrong.,34,TimOfAltona
486," and  this PM does, irrespective of the merits, is attacked by the Labor/Greens cheer squad in the Guardian threads. It's been going on since roughly 9 pm on Saturday Sept 7 last year. ",36,TimOfAltona
487,You must have been living under a rock for the past few weeks -  the government has done has been aimed at preventing home grown terrorism - that's why the Labor/Greens supporters are up in arms. ,38,TimOfAltona
488,"You see, people won't trust another Labor/Greens government so soon - particularly with all the Labor leadership dysfunction still swirling around and the ALP grappling with it's defacto marriage with the Greens ( do they split or do they still cuddle up with each other in bed?)  the overall future direction of the ALP still up in the air after the crash and burn of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd experiments. ",70,TimOfAltona
489,"What a sad and sorry bunch the Labor/Greens cheer squad are these days - first they criticise him for not going up there, then they criticise for being up there (wasting taxpayers money &amp; running the country from a tent) and now they criticise him for perhaps returning early due to events in the Middle East. ",57,TimOfAltona
490,So in your view the PM should go up there but have no contact with the people he is visiting just in case a photographer captures the moment and the PM is portrayed favourably in the image? ,38,TimOfAltona
491,Bottom line is you have no bloody idea what discussions the PM had in private with Yolngu elders yet you manufacture your version to denigrate Abbott - unless of course you come back to us and tell us you were sitting down with the PM and the Yolngu elders and heard for yourself what was discussed then your posts may have a little more credibility.,65,TimOfAltona
492,Julie Bishop has actually grown in stature in the job - she has created a very positive image for herself and Australia over her handling of the MH17 disaster and the Iraq crisis. ,34,TimOfAltona
493,"The left don't like it because it portrays the government in a positive light on the world stage - something Labor struggled to do under Rudd (all talk, no action)",30,TimOfAltona
494,"The 'government' can't go around picking up people off the streets. They do not have the powers. Arresting people suspected of crimes is up to the police, state or federal. ",31,TimOfAltona
495,Seems the labor cheer squad won't be happy until some form of terrorist attack occurs on Australian soil and then they will be howling that the government did not do enough to prevent it. ,35,TimOfAltona
496,"Saudi Arabia use beheading as their form of capital punishment for criminals convicted of serious crimes whereas ISIS randomly rape, shoot or behead men, women and children on the basis they are christians or belong to some other non-Sunni minority group - hardly comparable.",44,TimOfAltona
497,"Could someone from the Labor/Greens cheer squad please send Christine Milne some links showing the horrific atrocities being carried by ISIL/ISIS/IS or whatever they are now called, so that she can also start supporting the bi-partisan action against this evil. ",41,TimOfAltona

501,I think you are a bit confused - it was not Peter Dutton who overturned the trial at all - it was the Norfolk Island Administrator Gary Hardgrave who cited concerns about the legality plus endangering the native Green Parrot.  ,42,TimOfAltona
502,Perhaps he would not be so quick to satirise a deadly serious situation if he knew the true extent of the threat or is it that bombings or beheadings must occur before the left cheer squad wake up and join the rest of Australia? ,45,TimOfAltona

508,I don't see many damning Labor's decision to support the government Daisy in fact they are being applauded by mainstrean Australia - perhaps that's what the ALP are looking for here?,31,TimOfAltona

513,"I also add that the accompanying threat by Sinaloa is that they survive not only through killings of competitors but also widespread corruption of police, military and government officials. ",30,TimOfAltona
514,You raise a very good point Daisy - the Sinaloa cartel do represent a real threat to Australia given the atrocities they commit in Mexico funded by billionaire drug bosses. ,31,TimOfAltona
515,The difference between the two groups is that ISIS is all about religion/ideology and seek to destroy those of different beliefs whereas Sinaloa is all about the money and tend to target and kill only those involved in the drug trade - not butchering thousands of innocent men women and children. ,52,TimOfAltona
516,"That was not the question I was responding to... he wanted to know how a dual Australian/Israeli citizen performing military/conscription service with the IDF and being required to enter Gaza, which may be a 'no travel' area given Hamas is a prescribed terrorist organisation would be treated by the proposed new legislation.",52,TimOfAltona
517,IDF are not a prescribed terrorist organisation and are in Gaza as a direct result of a lawful direction from the Israeli government to combat terrorism against the state of Israel.,31,TimOfAltona

522,"Actually Ann, you will find that the numbers of people from the left who think Abbott is on the right track with some of this stuff is much greater than you imagine. ",33,TimOfAltona
523,Gillard's problem is she never justified or properly explained her knifing of Rudd to the Australian people - it was all up in the air and noone knew what she stood for.,32,TimOfAltona

527,I think you will even find the ALP also think we have a potential terrorist problem which is why they are in lock step with the government's actions on this so far.,32,TimOfAltona
528,He was spot on about the failed Gillard experiment - she totally lacked any authority either inside her party or outside and very nearly brought the ALP to its knees as a result.  ,35,TimOfAltona
529,He was also spot on when he said unpopularity is not necessarily a bad thing for a politician providing they are strong and have the authority - voters respect that. ,31,TimOfAltona

539,"By the way - any thoughts on Peter Slippers sentence today? You know, the guy you 'cleverly' drafted into the Speakers position to try and shore up the failing Gillard government's numbers? ",33,TimOfAltona
540,The media called it for what it was - an ineffectual and incompetent PM who was a Labor Party experimental blow-in who crashed and burned and nearly brought her whole god damn party down with her. ,37,TimOfAltona
541,It is such a shame that Australia's first female PM could not have been a person who was firstly voted in by the people and who also had the respect and support of Australians. What we had with Gillard was contempt and loathing.,43,TimOfAltona
542,"This Tony Abbott fellow must be some kind of demi-god - totally responsible for all the evil on this planet - every natural disaster, homicide, genocide, earthquake, famine, wars, pestilence, terrorist attacks, shark attacks, motor vehicle accidents, crime waves, riots, massacres etc etc etc are all down to the Australian PM.",51,TimOfAltona
543,As PM she was largely being scripted by John McTernan - pretty much every media appearance/statement by Gillard had her parroting scripts pre-prepared for her by McTernan - hence the robotic nature of her media appearances. ,37,TimOfAltona
544,The whole misogyny beat up was the brain child of McTernan scratching around for something that would resonate with the female vote and try and lift Gillard's dismal approval rating - he had previously used the same tactic against British PM David Cameron when he was advising the UK Labor party.,51,TimOfAltona
545,"Daisy, he said he would never do deals to ala Julia Gillard. Of course he has to negotiate to get bills passed through senate - it's the normal process when the government of the day does not hold a majority. Abbott will deal with PUP, Greens, Independents and even Labor to get bills passed. ",55,TimOfAltona
546,Naturally the Labor cheer squad then ignore the polls or call them a media conspiracy because they don't want to face up to Labor's inherent weaknesses - of which there are many.,32,TimOfAltona
547,"Labor supporters can argue amongst themselves all they like over whether it was Rudd or Gillard who brought the party to it's knees in the lower house last September , but the 3 key issues still exist that will keep them out of government for the next two terms at least, namely - ",54,TimOfAltona
548,"1. Leadership dysfunction and factional infighting. The ALP go to great lengths to keep a lid on these two corrosive ALP attributes, but they are always just below the surface bubbling away. Disunity is death. ",36,TimOfAltona
549,"2. The stigma of being viewed as nothing more than an extension of the powerful unions, some militant (Gillard was tainted by this). I get that Labor are the political arm of the union movement and all that but you only have to look at the makeup of the Labor senate and you pretty quickly see where all the old union hacks end up. Parachuting into the senate is a favourite pass time for ex-union officials looking for reward for their union stewardship.  ",85,TimOfAltona
550,3. The ALP's reliance on the Greens to both get them into government and then staying in government. You only have to look at what happened across the Tasman last Saturday to see what mainstream voters think of Labor/Greens governments - Australia is no different. Everyone can see that the Greens having helped the ALP then hold them hostage to Greens policies (again - Gillard and the Carbon Tax) and we really don't want to go down that path again. ,81,TimOfAltona
551,"She may have been a good person and all that, but she was totally inept in this role and very nearly lead the ALP to a defeat they may have never recovered from. ",34,TimOfAltona
552,"Rudd, for all his faults did save some of Labor's furniture last September. Had Gillard not been removed by Shorten et al, Labor would have been lucky to be holding 30 seats in this current Parliament such was the loathing Australian voters had for Gillard. ",46,TimOfAltona
553,This woman is a product of Clive Palmer placing newspaper ads in Tasmanian newspapers calling for Tasmanians to apply to join his party as a senate candidate...could be she was the only one who stuck her hand up. ,39,TimOfAltona
554,"What I don't get is how she went on Insiders knowing the discussion/questioning would be about muslims, hijabs and Islam and she had no idea how to describe or explain sharia law when asked by Barry Cassidy - it was a classic Pauline Hanson moment and made her sound totally inept.",51,TimOfAltona
555,He's part of that esteemed group of Guardian commentators who think this whole thing is a conspiracy between ISIS and the Australian government designed to keep the current Australian PM in office.,32,TimOfAltona
556,He's a regular left-wing activist in these threads - attacks anything the conservative Australian government do to stop the terrorism threat through fear that any success in this area will see the current government be re-elected in 2 years time.,40,TimOfAltona
557,"You can't be serious - how many failed Immigration ministers did Labor trawl through over the 6 years not one of them able to achieve what Morrison has in his first year - Boats stopped, detention centres being emptied out and best of all, possibly hundreds of lives saved. ",50,TimOfAltona
558,We all worked out why the Labor/Greens cheer squad don't like Morrison - because he showed Labor up to be the incompetent government they were when it came to border protection and proved to Australian voters that we got it right by voting the Coalition in to fix up Labor's mess and we will all over again in 2016.,59,TimOfAltona
559,Morrison is very good communicator - his performance in parliament is up there with the best. I can see him moving into more senior government portfolios over the next few years.,31,TimOfAltona
560,Abbott actually made a pretty good speech on his UN debut - he had the world's most powerful leaders tuned into his narrative on fighting ISIS - made Australia look very good. ,33,TimOfAltona
561,Watching Abbott presenting at the UN Security Council begs the question - can anyone see the leader of the alternative Australian government sitting at the Security Council table dealing with these critical issues?  ,35,TimOfAltona
562,My advice to the Labor supporters - you had better get a wiggle on and sort out your leadership problems - trying to change leaders too close to the next election guarantees you will remain in the political wilderness for another two terms at least.,45,TimOfAltona
563,Joe does have a lot of fun at Wayne Swan's expense - checking under 'S' in the index of Swanny's book for the word 'Surplus' - no where to be found. ,32,TimOfAltona
564,"Despite what many Labor/Greens supporters contend in these threads, I'm pretty certain that ISIS and the Liberal Party did conspire with each other and arrive at a genocide plan for Iraq and Syria in order to secure Tony Abbott's re-election in 2016. ",43,TimOfAltona
565,"To all the Labor Gillard supporters on here I say this - I'm with you,Gillard should not have been knifed by her own party &amp; replaced by Rudd. She should have stayed on and lead Labor to an even greater crushing defeat last September. ",45,TimOfAltona
566,I hear the book stores have already got it on 50% off a day or two after it's launch - wait another couple of days and it will be in the 90% off bargain bin out the front of Dymocks.,40,TimOfAltona
567,"Andrew, you missed the bit where the rather jovial &amp; harmless looking fellow with the balaclava is randomly raping, shooting, crucifying and beheading men, women and children from christian, Shiite, Kurdish and other assorted minority groups who's only crime is that they happen to be in the way of these terrorists establishing their 'caliphate'.  ",56,TimOfAltona
568,Clearly you disagree with the 'west' trying to stop this genocide - if you are representative of the Labor/Greens cheer squad on this issue then I put it to you that it will be many many years before Labor and Greens will be trusted with governing this country again. ,50,TimOfAltona
569,This is the action of a strong government fixing up a bloody big mess created by Labor ineptitude - starting with Rudd handing the people smugglers a beautifully crafted business model to work with - what we see today is the result of all that. ,46,TimOfAltona
570,Congratulations to Morrison - ultimately the camps at Nauru and Manus will be emptied and shut down and since the boats have stopped arriving they will remain shut......until the next Labor/Greens government get into power and then it starts all over again..,42,TimOfAltona
571,"Milne has dealt herself and her party out of contention for anything in 2016 and Labor are, well...just Labor....hanging onto anything that they think will keep them in touch with the current government...but know deep down they must surely lose Round 2 in 2016.",44,TimOfAltona
572,A poor bloke on his ipad walks through security at the airport and the Labor/Greens cheer squad are calling for the Australian PM to resign because it's all Abbott's fault¡­..  ,32,TimOfAltona
573,A win for the refugees who have the opportunity to start afresh in a safe country which is signatory to the 1951 refugee convention along with financial assistance from Australia ,31,TimOfAltona
574,"A win for Australia because it means the off shore detention centres will in time be emptied &amp; closed (What will the Greens have to complain about then?), the boats have stopped so there are no more people arriving to fill them up (unlike under Labor) and our orderly UNHCR migration program can continue and those genuine refugees and their families can look forward to being welcomed into Australia with open arms and assimilate into our community. ",78,TimOfAltona
575,I suspect you will find a couple of seriously injured policemen in hospital who would disagree that this person's only offence was being a person of interest comrade - oh....and about 20 million Australians as well.,36,TimOfAltona
576,Wrong - Morrison will be our next Defence Minister - Turnbull will possibly replace Abbott when Abbott goes - mind you Julie Bishop is growing in stature here and overseas - don't rule it out.,35,TimOfAltona
577,I guess a country with a population of 15.5m people can absorb a paltry few hundred people - particularly as the Australian government is covering the cost of their resettlement. ,31,TimOfAltona
578,If Labor are to have any chance in 2016 they need to ditch their reliance on the Greens to get them over the line - this is where it all starts to go pear shape because  the Greens Labor can't get the numbers so 2016 will be a choice between the incumbent Coalition and another Labor/Greens cabal. ,59,TimOfAltona
579,Abbott's use of the 'Light on the Hill' analogy was a masterstroke. ALP should be incredibly proud it took a conservative PM to quote Ben Chifley at a UN General Assembly address.  ,34,TimOfAltona
580,"C'mon Ian, you and I both know that is not true. This government has steady hand and we will all emerge from this period in an ok state. Keeping Australia's economy on track is the key to social, economic and political stability. ",43,TimOfAltona
581,"Rest assured, Labor will eventually rebuild, though it is some years off yet, and will once more occupy the Treasury benches (although the leadership &amp; front bench by then will have changed considerably from what we see today). ",39,TimOfAltona
582,"I wouldn't be too hard on Shorten - the Abbott government is showing strong leadership over these issues - Labor has no choice but to stay with the government or else they will end up being perceived, like the Greens, as largely irrelevant when it comes to national security and fighting terrorism - this in turn guarantees successive Coalition governments in power for the next few years. Albo would be doing the same thing if was LOTO in my opinion.",80,TimOfAltona
583,Good comment. The left use that term to try and land blows against the government - in fact it shows up their ignorance - nothing can compare to the abject horrors of WWII concentration camps. ,36,TimOfAltona
584,The situation on Manus or Nauru is far from ideal and eventually these centres will be emptied &amp; closed down (what will the Greens have to complain about then?) but the undeniable fact is that perhaps hundreds of lives have been spared from drowning since the government delivered on it's pre-election promise¡­.why is this fact always ignored/overlooked by the Labor/Greens cheer squad? ,63,TimOfAltona
585,"In the meantime, these allegations of self-harm and impropriety need to be investigated as well as serious allegations that some STC employees were actively engaged in encouraging detainees to fabricate abuse.",31,TimOfAltona
586,"I think the left already suspect the next election is beyond them - this government, with or without Abbott as PM will likely go for at least another 2 terms. ",31,TimOfAltona
587,"You are right in that Iraq and Syria is a distraction from domestic politics and it is not only the government that is hidden, but also very much the Labor opposition. I think both sides of politics would prefer we did not have to deal with ISIS.",47,TimOfAltona
588,Funny how the left  see the Abbott government at fault here - but ignore Labor who would be going down the same path if they were in government. ,30,TimOfAltona
589," - In the ""face of evil,"" nations of good conscience do have a responsibility to act.""I reconfirmed to the Prime Minister, Labor's support for this important development.""When it comes to fighting terror, Labor and the government are working together."" ",41,TimOfAltona
590,The families wanted a RC into the circumstances around the deaths of their children to help provide closure and determine the sequence of events that lead to the multiple tragedies.  ,32,TimOfAltona
591,My point is valid - so many Labor/Greens supporters are more concerned about the prospect of a rise in the government's popularity than they are in the genocide occurring on a daily basis in Nth Iraq and Syria. ,39,TimOfAltona
592,"QLD Labor suffers from the same disease inflicting federal Labor - Poor leadership, reliance on disreputable unions and cosying up to the Greens to try and get across the line. ",31,TimOfAltona
593,Labor and their supporters need to seriously look at internal party reform if they are to have any hope over the next few years - confected attacks against Abbott or Newman is not the strategy you need to win back government..,41,TimOfAltona
594,"I'm confused - when Newspoll shows Qld Labor are in front, all the Labor supporters applaud the result as proof that Labor will win the next election and Newman is finished - but when Newspoll shows the Newman government are in front of Labor, according to the Labor supporters (see plenty below), Newspoll is immediately transformed into a Murdoch conspiracy to keep the LNP in government and should be totally disregarded. ",72,TimOfAltona
595,You may be a bit confused - Defence Dept and C'wealth Health have provided that advice to the government...it was not the government's decision. The minister is acting on advice from the experts.,33,TimOfAltona
596,This decision was made by both the Defence Dept and the Commonwealth Health Dept who duly advised the government of the day - I'm fairly certain the same decision would have been forthcoming if it was a Labor government and a Labor government would likewise be heeding the expert advice from Health and Defence.,54,TimOfAltona
597,"...or my personal favourite from the Australian left - If Tony Abbott was  Australian PM, everyone would be living in peace and harmony in the Middle East. That one's a doozy.",32,TimOfAltona
598,I think there is a bit of confusion over the interpretation of Abbott's comments - he was referring to foreign citizens temporarily visiting Australia specifically to preach hate and division amongst minority communities. ,34,TimOfAltona
599,"Where the airstrikes are very useful is targeting IS vehicle movements between towns - they move in convoys in utes, 4WD's, captured humvees, captured Iraqi tanks and armoured vehicles as they go from town to town. ",37,TimOfAltona

901,"Coal's market share might be declining, but because energy markets are growing, the amount of coal demanded is still expanding. The ASEAN nations for example expect coal demand to rise 40% in the next 25 years. ",36,TheJediMaster
902,"Climate conventions like COP21 really should be presenting facts and forecasts, not become an ideological opponent of existing fuel types. When will they start going after petrol for example ?",30,TheJediMaster

904,"It's probably better if he does move on, but if Abbott does decide to stay then hopefully it would include a good long chat with Turnbull beforehand. If they can reach a mutually acceptable working relationship, then Abbott could continue to make a positive contribution to the Australian parliament and people.",51,TheJediMaster
905,That's odd - when Obama was here in Australia a year ago for the G20 he was rude enough to suggest to our conservative party that they weren't doing enough about climate change.  ,33,TheJediMaster

912,"Actually John the accounting principles are rather straight forward - dodgy accruals. In 2011-12 our spending had exploded to a whopping $371 billion. To give the illusion that spending had fallen during the ""we've returned to surplus"" fairytale, Swannie transferred a heap of expenditure to the 2013-14 year, taking it out of 2012-13.

921,"It's a brave person who claims that Australia's emissions are rising. The NGGI report clearly shows a downward trend in CO2 emissions overall, and in most sectors over the past ten years.  ",32,TheJediMaster
