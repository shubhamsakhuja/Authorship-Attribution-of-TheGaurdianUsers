1,"Some people will be happy with a day of battery power when it is cloudy in the middle of winter, and then they will use candles. Others want to never run out of power and will wants 2 weeks of power reserve, but they will pay dearly for the batteries, and they are prepared to pay. ",57,InfinityAndBeyond
2,Once it is a grid based system there is no personal responsibility. People will use the power and complain when the batteries run out. So more and more batteries will be put in and the electricity prices will rise. ,40,InfinityAndBeyond
3,"I don't think anyone would complain about a solar PV farm next to them, unlike wind turbines. But base load is the problem. And if you are going to have batteries, that is better managed at each consumers premises than trying to have enormous grid based batteries.",47,InfinityAndBeyond
4,"But the politicians should be convincing the public of why they want to sign such a treaty, and spell out in detail, not motherhood statements, exactly what the benefits are to Australians. The benefits should be quantified and backup up with evidence.",42,InfinityAndBeyond

8,Company directors only have a duty to the shareholders that elected them. The company does not have any legal interests other than the shareholders interest. The correct term is corporations law,31,InfinityAndBeyond
9,That is the silliest thing I have heard today. Corporates have no duty to be advocates for sections of the public. Other wise if the didn't they would be failing their duty? Are Hungry Jacks and Subway failing their public duty?,41,InfinityAndBeyond

13,Nah they were from Sri Lanka. Not refugees. Economic migrants. No reason in 2015 to be leaving Sri Lanka other than for economic reasons. Even the UN is repatriating people to Sri Lanka.,33,InfinityAndBeyond
14,Shorten said those with significant assets should not get a pension. So the Libs are cutting out higher asset people from getting the pension and at the same time boosting the pension for those with modest assets.  ,39,InfinityAndBeyond
15,"The whole ISIS issue is because Obama prematurely and pig-headedly removed all the troops that were ensuring security and safety in the region. He was warned but did it anyway, just to appease pressure groups.",35,InfinityAndBeyond
16,"Your statement is not relevant in this case because they were not refugees, they were not even asylum seekers (a difference in case you didn't know), they were merely economic migrants from Sri Lanka. There is no reason in 2015 to be leaving Sri Lanka, even the UN can attest to that.",52,InfinityAndBeyond
17,"That is a myth. The reality is that 85% are still on welfare 5 years later, as you would expect. We already don't have enough jobs for everyone in Australia. More people will just be on welfare, and with poor English, no skills, and no experience, of course it will be the asylum seekers on the welfare.",57,InfinityAndBeyond
18,It is a neo-Marxist philosophy of open borders to set up a one world government all under the control of the UN and reporting to Moscow. There is much worse that the loony left want but don't put in print these days as it will frighten the natives.  ,50,InfinityAndBeyond
19,"They also believe that land shouldn't be owned by individuals, and we should all be living in tiny little apartments so there is no suburban sprawl, leaving most of Australia for the animals and Aboriginal ownership. Yes Aboriginals are allowed to own land, but no one else. No cars, just public transport.",52,InfinityAndBeyond
20,"The Lefties invented group-think. Comes from them being a collective, where you have to fit in, and dissenting views indicate you might not be one of them. So independent thought becomes a forgotten skill. Just like a paddock of sheep.",40,InfinityAndBeyond

22,That's why you have the Senate. When 0.5% of the population wants to vote a particular way they have influence and will be listened to as can get a couple of people in. ,34,InfinityAndBeyond
23,"But I see right though your arguments. You are really wanting Aboriginals to have their own elections for their own members in parliament. Just forget it, it wont happen. That sort of discrimination by giving a minority a greater vote will always be rejected, and I will be one of the first to reject it.",55,InfinityAndBeyond
24,"This isn't getting anywhere. You keep saying in vague terms that the electoral system is wrong. You say the boundaries are wrong and that it was done by white man, but what does that mean? What precisely is wrong? Do you have an example? ",45,InfinityAndBeyond
25,You seem to be claiming the boundaries are gerrymandered. Do you have any evidence/examples as I find if difficult to believe in this day and age that it has gone unchallenged? ,32,InfinityAndBeyond

30,"Their messiah that rose from the ashes of Rudd and Gillard and who they expected to win in 2016 with the exact same failed policies from the previous term in government, is now starting to look like another failed ALP leader, just another Mark Latham.",45,InfinityAndBeyond

32,Yes but who will pay to get on a boat knowing the crew will try and get more money from Australia and take them back where they started from? ,30,InfinityAndBeyond
33,"I am not racist, I want nearly all migration stopped. Only let in a restricted number of migrants of up to 25,000 per year of any nationality for family reunion that also meet the requirement of skills that are needed and a good prospect of supporting themselves and accumulating enough money in superannuation to support themselves in retirement. Australia is not a charity, our charitable money is via foreign aid.",70,InfinityAndBeyond
34,"So all the unpopulated land is a moot point Refugees only want to live in Sydney and Melbourne and by world standards for comparable lifestyles they are very big cities. By all measures, without reducing lifestyle, Australia is full. ",40,InfinityAndBeyond
35,"It is not just the manufacturers that charge Australia more, but the distributors in Australia have added much higher margins by maneuvering themselves into a position where they can be much wealthier than their overseas counterparts on the back of lover sales volume then their counterparts. Just because you have a small business in Australia seems to mean a Mercedes and a weekender at Portsea. ",66,InfinityAndBeyond
36,"A classic example was photo film processing. We paid much more in Australia than overseas did. And we paid subsidies to Kodak. When digital cameras came in, Australia had the worlds most rapid uptake of digital cameras, not because of tech savvy, just because of being ripped for so many years. ",52,InfinityAndBeyond
37,Australia is a captive market. It is like buying a meat pie at the AFL Grand Final. Expect to pay far more than could possibly be justified just because you are trapped within.,33,InfinityAndBeyond

44,"Good to see they can put aside their partisan politics and do what is in Australia's interest and what nearly all Australians want, regardless of the very vocal but tiny minority.",31,InfinityAndBeyond
45,"Gillard would be the most useless PM of modern times. She took Rudds 52% and reduced it to 50% in a matter of months, and over the next 3 years took the party to what would be the greatest arse caning at an election a sitting government has ever had. Luckily Rudd stepped in and saved her sorry arse from a very embarrassing defeat.",64,InfinityAndBeyond

64,"The key point with the list is that it is only based on the last 30 years, and for a small airline it could be unsafe and taking risks, but statistically its number has not come up. ",38,InfinityAndBeyond
65,Air NZ has come from the depths of the list to No 1 because its big crash of controlled flying into the side of a mountain in Antarctica has just fallen out of the 30 year period.,37,InfinityAndBeyond

67,If you notice there are no structures in the grounds that can act as protection. I am sure a few gazebos in the yards would have come in handy in the recent riots.,33,InfinityAndBeyond
68,I am not for more compassion as I think we are being taken for a ride with people claiming refugee just because they want to move to a western country. I want more reality. Like when asylum seekers are granted PR and then go back home for a holiday. Time for Australia to wake up that we are being conned.,60,InfinityAndBeyond
69,"The issue is, if Shorten doesn't announce where he stands on boats well in advance of the election, and I mean announce it now, then come the election whatever he announces at the 11th hour will not be believed. ",40,InfinityAndBeyond

71,"There is also the issue of working out the tax if it is on earnings above $75k. How does a fund do that, as they don't know what other super you have? What if you have 3 funds? What if you have 2 funds you have forgotten about many years ago? ",52,InfinityAndBeyond
72,Huh swashbuckling? But Swan should have taken a sword and slashed his spending. The Libs would have supported it. The Libs keep trying to do it now but Labor blocks it.,31,InfinityAndBeyond
73,"Most of the budget problem is from spending. The next problem area is corporate taxation with dodgy profit shifting offshore, and also when they off-shore their work then less income tax is collected in Australia. These are the real problem areas.",41,InfinityAndBeyond
74,"There is no tax free money going into super, if you haven't paid tax on it the super fund pays 15%, or you can put in money after you have paid tax on it. There is no way around it. ",41,InfinityAndBeyond
75,"It is strictly limited how much you can put into super as tax free money as $25k for under 50 yo and $35k above that, and then the fund pays tax on it. ",34,InfinityAndBeyond
76,"So these days you really cant get a big super fund because of the limit on contributions. Anyone with a big super fund is usually because they have taken high risk investments that have paid off, when most people have lost their money in high risk investments. ",48,InfinityAndBeyond
77,"Which get to the next point of the reason for super. It was not only to provide retirement benefits but to provide a national source of funds for investment in Australia. The bulk of super funds is in Australian shares. If they tax the big returns which are usually from risky speculative investments, then those investments will not me made. Funds will just invest in bank shares instead. For Australia's benefit someone has to invest in the riskier investments.",79,InfinityAndBeyond
78,"If super is taxed on earnings above $75k, many average income people will pay it, because in super you make very small profits most years, and then you catch up with a boomer year. Considering most years the returns are about 2.5%, then you get a boomer year of 12%. So to never pay tax you can't have more than $625k in super, which is about the average amount people have in their super when they retire. ",78,InfinityAndBeyond

83,They didn't do what they are legally required to do. And that is to apply to VCAT or whatever to break the lease. It is in the tenants hand book.,30,InfinityAndBeyond

85,Any sane person would renovate it and turn it into a freshly renovated place which people pay are willing to pay a lot of rent for. Everyone likes newly renovated. ,31,InfinityAndBeyond
86,"I will give a simple example. Say the migrant was coming from Sicily, then profile would alert possible Mafia member. The migration application then goes through an intensive investigation to see if there is evidence they are not mafia, and the onus is on the person to provide the requested information.",51,InfinityAndBeyond
87,"You are being distracted. Look at what the really serious offence is, and that is terrorism. A little white lie is not in the same category as Monis who wanted to and did kill people.",35,InfinityAndBeyond
88,"As I said earlier, the Australian Police forces have sophisticated methods and data for profiling the risk of offending. If these methods and data had been used for immigration, then probably Monis would not have been able to get into Australia in the first place. It is about making Australia as safe as it can be.",56,InfinityAndBeyond
89,"You mean lies like ""no carbon tax under a government I lead"" and promises for 5 years in a row that the budget would be in surplus, but all were massive deficits?",32,InfinityAndBeyond

98,"It's important that it puts inspections in place. Inspections are not always designed to catch you red-handed but rather to elicit a response about what it is that you are up to. The threshold for pain is so high that you don't want to break the rules, and I think this puts that in place while also making it extremely difficult to cheat. ",64,InfinityAndBeyond
99,"But if you consider that it is flow forming machines are how you make centrifuges. If you have one stashed away out in the middle of the desert in a facility, we would have no idea. In the agreement, they have to account for all of their flow forming machines, give us a list of where they are, and then put them under monitoring. The counter to that is they just won't tell us, they won't declare everything. That's to be expected, so don't trust that.",86,InfinityAndBeyond

101,The satellite can determine the position of your EPIRB to within 5km. The coded message identifies the exact vessel to which the EPIRB is registered. This information allows the rescue services to eliminate false alerts and launch an appropriate rescue. ,41,InfinityAndBeyond
102,GPS-enabled EPIRBs have a built-in transmitter which will typically alert the rescue services within 3 minutes and to a positional accuracy of +/- 50 metres (updated every 20 minutes) given a clear view skywards.  ,36,InfinityAndBeyond

108,"At the G20 and at Lima, it was agreed by all member states that China and India could increase their emissions, and in China's case that was to increase emissions until 2030. And increased emissions essentially means one thing, more coal. ",42,InfinityAndBeyond

He caught a flight to Sydney and hired a hire car and drove the three hours over the mountains to Bathurst. No helicopter was considered.¡±
She has paid it back. But the following people from the ALP have also been going to fundraisers at the taxpayers expense: Burke, Bowen, Shorten, Wong. 
The same for them I say.
Agree.
And my point is that NONE of the stuff on the ALP came from the leftie media. If you only read leftie or rightie media you will only be half informed.
To those that have only been listening to left wing media, here is a link to Shorten and Wong claiming travel expenses to the Bathurst fund raiser. 
 
Seems the ALP expectation is that MPs use their travel expenses to pay for their party travel:-
So what will happen about Shorten and Wongs flight at the tax payers expense to Bathurst for a fund raiser? 
Or nothing. That is the double standard of the Lefties.
I am hoping for someone tougher than Bishop to keep the ALP front bench on a short leash.
What about Shorten and Wongs flights to Bathurst for a fundraiser? Same deal. 
When will Shorten and Wong stand down?
Bogans vote ALP. 
Chardonnay socialists might like to think the ALP is made up entirely by people like them, but in reality they are a minority.
You don't even know what the claimed changes are, of if they even exist. Yet somehow you have jumped to the strikers defence. Have you ever considered they just want MORE money?
So what exactly are the changes to the allowances? Credible link with details please?
So you don't know any details of their claim either? 
Sounds like they just want more money and are twisting the numbers to claim they are worse off. 
I am calling BS on their grievance!
If the APSU does not want the public to be angry at them, they need to publicise exactly what the conditions they claim are being taken off them are. 
A vague claim that some could be $8000 a year worse off, does not cut it. How, why, will they be worse off. 
The court of public opinion judges harshly when no evidence is provided.
If you read the article they have had their review already.  
Manus is finding 56% genuine according to PNG PM many months ago. So I don't know why you keep using the old percentage.
So why the concern for people who were scamming the system?
But these are not refugees.  
These are people who claimed they were refugees, but when they were checked they were found to be lying, they are not refugees.
The Refugee Action Coalition will never tell them it is better for them to return, they will lead them on with false hope. The will be pawns.
I have compassion, but these people got on a boat came here claiming they were refugees, and when they get checked out, they find they are not refugees at all. 
So what is there to be compassionate over?
And that something else is voluntarily deciding to return home.
Perhaps they can sue the refugee advocates that told them to throw their papers overboard.
Very true. The real problem is the population growth. But that is the elephant in the room for refugee advocates.
These people are the 10%.
I think you will find most are simply refusing to go back to their home country. Most likely the Australian Government will give them a $10k sweetener to go back.
Either a gullible fool, or having a hidden agenda of really wanting open borders and using asylum seekers as a wedge.
Obviously these people are the 10%.
Wouldn't that be ex-asylum seekers? After they are found to not be a refugee how can they still be an asylum seeker?
What? That people who are not refugees don't get given refugee status? 
What is the world coming to!!
Yes I know that for a fact. The headline gave it away. Notice the word rejected:- 
 
Which bit of 'rejected' didn't you get?
Really? Is that their circumstances? Do you think anyone that lives in a war zone automatically has a right to come here if they are determined to be a refugee or not? 
Just think for a moment, they have FAILED their refugee assessment. These are not refugees.
You are forgetting these are not refugees!!!! 
They have been found to not be refugees and then failed their appeal. 
So any comparison to real refugees is a distortion and misleading.
Very true.  
The issue is that these die-hards are really advocates of open borders, but they don't want to say that and scare the natives. 
So they say it is about refugees, until someone is found to not be a refugee, and then they revert to just let-them-in. But in doing so it reveals their true agenda. 
Their hidden agenda is now not so hidden.
Was invited. I didn't gate crash. 
But these are not refugees. So unless you are advocating for open borders, precisely what is your issue?
These are not refugees! 
Just because they wanted to come to Australia doesn't mean we have to let them in.
And 10,000 people, what an economic powerhouse Nauru is.  
So you still haven't shown a small population can be economic while supporting a full government. Or should they do the leftie borrowing path and become anotheraGreece?
At least we are helping Nauru by setting up a detention centre there and providing some employment.
There are local governments with more people than the NT.

Cant we just walk away now, for good?
And Gilkard used the government jet to fly to a wedding in Byron Bay, but that's ok because she is not a Liberal.
What about Chris Bowen and tony Burke? They have just paid back their flights.  
And Bill Shorten and Penny Wong charged tax payers for a plane to Bathurst for a fund raiser, and Wayne Swan charged $8000 for a plane to a fund raiser, so what is the difference with Bishop? 
Oh that is right, she is a Lib, and that is the only difference.
And your explanation? 
NB I am hoping for something better than the person went in the water.
Are they white pointers? I don't think so. 
You whole bizarre argument seems to be based on tit for tat. Because sharks get killed for fins it is ok for sharks to eat a human.  
Is this really what you meant or did it just come out wrong?
Do you think the top predators are hungry? 
Would being amongst the breaking waves on the beach qualify as having gone elsewhere? Discuss.
Do you want a silly answer to your silly question?
We have created an ecological imbalance. Sharks are protected and we are heavily fishing their food source. 
So lots of big sharks and not much food.  
Guess what the sharks do next?
Perhaps something sharper, but you are on the right track.
A targeted cull of large sharks only. 
Scientists should be able to come up with hook sizes and baits that only a large shark can get hooked on.
Or a cull.
Or cull sharks so all is in balance. People have to eat you know.
The explanation is quite simple, even if the greenies don't want to face up to it. 
Great whites have been protected since 1999 are no longer fished for. Since then their numbers have been increasing, and without fishing many are growing very large. 
At the same time, trawler fishing has depleted the sharks food source. Australia is pretty much fished out. Try catching a fish is you have any doubt. Large sharks need large food, and lots of it.  
Without fishing for sharks it is only the food supply limiting the number of sharks, and they will always be hungry. 
We are overfishing the food and protecting the sharks. We have created an ecological imbalance. 
It is time for sharks to be culled so that their numbers are more in line with the food availability.
It is alright for you to say that, you don't have to put up with the wind turbines.  
And that is what rural communities find most offensive, is people from the cities making decisions about their communities.  
Stick the wind turbines in your city if you love them so much.
The wind farm industry looks a lot like the tobacco industry used to. 
The tobacco industry had all their scientific research proving tobacco caused no harm. 
How could simple smoke, cause disease? Where is the proof?
Emotion charged thinking is defective and contagious.
Would cost a few dollars more, and like all companies if they can not spend a few dollars they wont. 
So instead they rile up the pro windfarm lobby with fear mongering and have the pro windfarm lobby do their fighting for them, like loyal foot soldiers.
Ha ha ha you didn't read it all. The report found that normal scientific theories such as threshold did not seem to apply, and even the first line of my post was about the rumbling noises that could be heard that the scientific instruments could not detect. 
There is another scientific report I will dig out. It hypothesises that infrasound travels further (is known that low frequencies travel further) but that due to structures, the interference and bouncing forms higher frequency noise that can be heard. 
And there is another report that much of the infrasound is at the resonance frequencies of internal organs, stimulating muscle tension to try and stop the vibrations, and stress is a know cause of health issues. 
Looks like you need to read up more on the subject, and not just the greenie pro windfarm literature which is akin to reading scientific literature by the tobacco industry.
It is good that your NIMBY comment means you understand the turbines are effectively in their back yards. 
But what you should also understand is the huge impost on people and their community in noise and visually. They also divide communities with some people getting paid to put them in a paddock they own but don't live near, yet their affected neighbours get no compensation. 
That is why the 2 km exclusion zone was so good. 
But importantly you must understand that many do not share your ideology of wind power being a good source of power. It is expensive at least $1500 MWH for something that is intermittent and not base load. 
Particularly when they don't share your ideology they are not willing to take on the large permanent compromises to their lifestyle. 
So I am all for the 2 km exclusion zone.
I wouldn't want a wind farm next to my home. The 2 km exclusion zone is a good thing.
But they don't come along and stick a coal mine next to your house like they do with a wind farm.
They said the same thing about cigarettes and asbestos.
The significance is noise levels more than 30 dB higher in a house 3.3 km from the wind farm.
What a crazy conspiracy theory. Noisy turbine would not sit in the shelf gathering dust, they would be sold where noise does not matter. Where noise matters, a premium can be made by selling low noise turbines. a wind farm may have a mix of turbines.
Did you see my more recent post? More than 30 dB increase inside a house 3.3 km from the nearest turbine.  
This is what infra sound can do. It doesn't follow the same laws as higher frequencies do.

So what should happen to those with failed ASIO clearances?
Hypocrisy. You sledged a whole profession. You sledged customs officers.
Why do you think you can sledge and not be sledged back?  
Gillard thought that way too. 
I would never sledge anyone that did not sledge me first.
Yes I failed the test. Had to become a nurse instead.
There are at least 20 reasons for people to get an ASIO clearance in Australia besides defence force or joining ASIO.  
The first that should spring to mind is applying to be a customs officer at the airport.  
And no I am not one.
If you notice, I said the hard left, I didn't say the ALP.
All that proves is that the ALP s not left enough for you.
Lefties do. They want to take money off what they call 'rich people', and 'big business' and spend it on their wish list of things they want. 
They feel entitled to the money, even though it is not theirs.
Umm no.
You forgot the rest:- 
Then Obama rang him, they had a long chat, and he decided to continue in Syria.
What about Gillard taking the PM jet to a friends wedding in Byron Bay?? 
Is that ok because she is ALP?
No they are not. They are only entitled to protest for 'protected actions' and I don't believe they applied to Fair Work Commission for this action to be protected, so this protest was not protected so they should be docked half a days pay. That is the law.
The far left are going hard while at least there are still some children left in detention.  
Before long they wont have enough kids for a footy match.
You forgot:- 
anyone thinking they are entitled to other people's money are lefties
Ummm I said a clearance not an investigation. You should brush up on the difference.
Yes I have. 3 times.
Define children? Like the 15 yo Parramatta terrorist you mean? 
But clearly I was talking about their parent's ASIO clearancse, so I don't know if you are dumb or deceptive. Which is it?.
I don't want their parents who have failed ASIO clearances wandering around the streets of Australia, plotting the next terrorist attack. That is why we have ASIO clearances. Releasing their parents is not an option. 
So then there is the difficult decision of what to do with the children. Until a solution is found, unfortunately they need to stay in detention or go and live with relatives in Australia or their home country. But their parents are not to be released into Australia.
Ummm isn't 'community detention' being released??????? 
Sure they cant go on a world cruise at a whim, but they are not by any sense of the word in detention. 
So in detention is 93 now. Thanks for the latest update.
It has been in the media often enough. Please keep up.
And failed ASIO clearances?
What about failed ASIO clearances?
There were 2,000 kids in detention under Gillard 
Today there are about 104 kids. 
Do people understand why there are still kids in detention? 
For many it is because their parents have failed an ASIO security clearance and you cant release the kids into the community without their parents.
Presently there are about 104 kids in detention. 
Where were you when Gillard had 2,000 kids in detention????

Here is some infinite judgement for you of very measurable effect:- 
When you say 'Unanimous' don't you mean 'Anonymous'????
Ummm these are both secret groups carrying out illegal activities that directly or indirectly result in people being harmed. 
They are both as bad as each other. There is no difference between them.
They have money. They can pay hackers. 
Hacker Required Top pay rates - Immediate startApply KKK
AND illegal. 
Anonymous believe two wrongs make a right. 
They are wrong.
Now we need another activist group to hack into Anonymous and reveal their names to the world. 
Good for the goose, good for the gander. 
I am sure the KKK will be very interested in the identities of Anonymous.
There is. It is called being responsible for a sustainable world. Did your religious texts tell you to go and breed as much as you could?
A one child policy is a bit harsh and is for reducing the population, not merely preventing further growth.
That only works in western cultures.

And there is the underlying fallacy of your premise. That prosperity can be delivered to everyone. Yep that will be achieved straight after world peace.
Well said.  
There is no human right to populate unsustainably.
All countries should introduce a 2 child policy.  
It is the responsible thing to do for the planet, and for climate change.  
It is irresponsible to increase the worlds population.
It effectively was a 2 child policy now anyway, because if both parents were single children, then they are allowed have 2 children. 
It was a rule brought in many years ago to overcome the 4-2-1 problem of 4 grandparents but only 1 grandchild to share. 
You don't hear much about the 4-2-1 rule, because bleeding hearts don't want you to know about it because it waters down their argument against the 1 child policy.

Why shouldn't companies be footing the training bill themselves?  
It will be tax deductible to them so the taxpayer is still chipping in.

It is an easy fix Bill, just get rid of 457 visas. Companies will then train what they need. 
It is a ridiculous argument that Australia needs 457 visas. How could Australia not be capable of training what it needs? 
For example, the biggest category of 457 visa is for caf¨¦ manager.  
Who is stupid enough to believe Australia cant train enough caf¨¦ managers????
You need to brush up on your understanding of the Australian electoral system. People don't 'vote' for the PM, they vote for their local member.
In fact the Socialist Alternative could become a bigger organisation than the Greens, and if enough of them can avoid criminal charges for their violence at protests, they might be able to put some people into the Senate.
The party room did. 
And if your local member was in the party room, he represented you in voting for MT.

1249,"The Marxists and the global corporations have found common ground - destroy the middle class.

1259,"It is where companies can still emit CO2 to their hearts content, but they buy dodgy carbon credits from overseas, like paying someone not to cut down some trees this year, so they cut down other trees instead, and if you don't buy the carbon credit next year, they go and chop the very same trees down.

1260,"It is also a massive drain on the economy, with money flowing out of the economy with nothing in return other than a bit of paper. And being an 'import industry' an ETS drives the dollar making imports cheap and local producers and exporters cannot compete. ",47,InfinityAndBeyond
