1,Wonder why this would not be covered under PNG law - last I looked Manus was part of another sovereign state. Presumably our friends down at Maurice Blackburn feel they have a better chance of getting money from the Australian government than the PNG government. Will be an interesting test case.,51,TimOfAltona
2,Interesting hypothesis - doubt there will be leadership change just yet - the election is a long way off - Abbott has some plenty of time on his side to turn the polling around and they will later in the year. ,42,TimOfAltona
3,Spot on - the only problem is that Abbott will not go to an early election - (would you with polling like this?) - plenty of time for the polls to turn around before the 2016 election and the second term of this government starts. IMHO.,46,TimOfAltona
4,To the contrary - the government have released a series of policies that involve belt tightening - which is why we see the left bleating about losing their halcyon days of rivers of borrowed money flowing through the economy artificially propping everyone up. ,44,TimOfAltona
5,The government was always going to take a hit from the socialist set when they went about the task of fixing up 6 years of Labor's fiscal ineptitude.  ,30,TimOfAltona
6,"If Shorten (providing he is still leader) thinks he can get away with spinning ALP rhetoric until about 5 o'clock on election eve 2016 before he releases any economic policies and hopes Labor will just fall over the line, he is mistaken. ",43,TimOfAltona
7,How would you address welfare reform? Keep borrowing money from overseas to keep throwing at it? Or would you perhaps explore ways of reforming whilst still protecting the genuinely weak members of the community? ,35,TimOfAltona
8,I suspect you may be a bit confused - this is not the government proposing changes - it is the head of an independent panel Patrick McClure advising of his findings. ,32,TimOfAltona
9,Now c'mon - who's kidding who here - she left her party with 7 seats in a 90 odd seat parliament - the best political leader our country has seen in a long time??????,34,TimOfAltona
10,"You could be a little confused or mis-informed - this is not a policy, it is an initial report on findings which are now open to the public for input then a final report with recommendations back to the government later this year.",43,TimOfAltona
11,"1. The government (Kevin Andrews) is not  recommending these measures - he is discussing some aspects of the independant report coming from Patrick McClure, Sally Sinclair and Wesley Aird (worth taking a look at who these people are) ",40,TimOfAltona
12,3. Public submissions relating to the report findings are open until August 08.Feedback from the public and organisations operating or impacted by the report findings are critical to forming a final report along with recommendations back to the government.  ,41,TimOfAltona
13,5. If people have valid or genuine concerns (other than you just don't like a Coalition government in power) then feel free to make your concerns known to the panel who are encouraging feedback to assist them with their final report back to government. ,45,TimOfAltona
14,Hopefully this takes some of the hysteria and misinformation out of the comments in this thread - there is a need to review the current system and the genuine faults that exist.,32,TimOfAltona
15,What sort of world do you live in? Let's get back to reality - a % of young people spend their welfare money on alcohol &amp; illegal drugs. In your world you think the government should continue to encourage alcohol and drug dependencies through welfare payments? ,47,TimOfAltona
16,My advice to you is firstly read the full report (link in the article) - you will find references to your situation - if you still have concerns or want to make a statement direct to the DSS you have until August 08 to make a submission. ,48,TimOfAltona
17,Feedback by way of public submissions will assist a final report and recommendations. You do have a voice on this particular issue - the authors of the discussion paper want to hear from people in your situation to assist them with a final report/recommendation. ,45,TimOfAltona
18,"If you take the time to read both the article and the report you will seethis sequence is underway - reacting to a head line without understanding the detail leads too many people, yourself included, into making a ""thought bubble"" comment devoid of fact.",44,TimOfAltona
19,The government should be taking a look at this - the report has identified areas where inefficiencies and disincentives to people working exist. Overall good to see the government exploring any improvements to the current system - what comes out of this remains to be seen. ,47,TimOfAltona
20,Let's hear what the ALP say about this - oh that's right - they support off shore processing as well and will endorse the government transferring these people to Manus or Nauru *Labor cheer squad go silent*,37,TimOfAltona
21,If they are that far from Christmas Island - assuming there is a boat in the first place - then Indonesia is the closest to steer their 'stricken' boat to safety - or are they waiting for the RAN taxi pickup service? ,43,TimOfAltona
22,If Rintoul is encouraging them to stay at sea to try and make it to Christmas Island then if something goes wrong he will have some serious explaining to do.,30,TimOfAltona
23,Bishop's stature in the international community has been growing and Australia's support for the new regime in Burma will help transition the country into a true democracy in time. Her meeting with the Rohingya community is also diplomatically significant and helps them get a voice internationally. ,47,TimOfAltona
24,"The problem with your argument is that if Australia treats children differently to adults, or more leniently then hey presto! hundreds of people smuggler boats laden with children will be departing Indonesian coast line headed for Australia. Then it's a numbers game as to how many make it and how many possibly perish at sea. ",56,TimOfAltona
25,"Exactly the same thing is happening in the US right now with tens of thousands of children entering the US from Central America, why? because the US, under Bush, provided for extra protection for children entering the US illegally...it has now got so out of hand that the Obama administration are about to repeal the legislation which provides automatic asylum for children and will start deporting them back to their country of origin, mainly Honduras and Nicaragua. ",78,TimOfAltona
26,"Perhaps Fairfax don't want their publications advertising rallies for far left organisations such as Socialist Alternative, Communist Party Australia, Get Up and the like who are behind these events you are trying to drum up support for. ",38,TimOfAltona
27,I'll sleep better tonight knowing that we have so many experts on Sri Lanka commenting in the Guardian thread - they all appear to have a far superior knowledge of the situation on the ground as it relates to Tamils than DFAT does. ,44,TimOfAltona
28,"By the way - these people on the boat, if they are Tamils, came from Southern India - Tamil Nadu - of which Chennai is the capital, the language is Tamil, population 72 million and has been home to the Tamil people since 1500 BC. ",46,TimOfAltona
29,Good to see Albrechtsen join the ABC selection panel. She has a wealth of journalism experience. Transparency is the key here and there is no reason to believe any board appointment decisions won't be made with the best interests of the ABC at the forefront. ,46,TimOfAltona
30,Tears them apart that this government has actually gone out and implemented a policy that has saved possibly thousands of lives from drowning at sea - you could be mistaken for thinking the left wanted the drownings that occurred under the last Labor/Greens government to continue just so they can point the finger of blame at the current government. ,60,TimOfAltona
31,Trying to portray these events as some kind of harmless fun filled family picnic day when they are in fact led by radical left wing organisations is deceiving people. ,30,TimOfAltona
32,"I think this is what Brandis is saying - it's the left wing Wikileaks campaigner cum lawyer, Greg Barnes who is saying we may not be able to detain people returning from fighting with outlawed terrorist groups in Iraq/Syria. ",40,TimOfAltona
33,"Fair dinkum - as soon as we have a major terrorist attack in Australia which kills and maims innocent people, all these left-wing do-gooders will all suddenly go silent and hope we don't remember that they were the ones who constantly frustrated the government's efforts to protect our borders.",49,TimOfAltona
34,Bottom line - the government is delivering on a pre-election promise and is shutting down the evil &amp; deadly people smuggling trade kick started by Kevin Rudd and Labor in 2007. ,32,TimOfAltona
35,Boats don't depart = people don't drown. Fairly simple equation lost on so many who advocate welcoming the ten of thousands who would otherwise attempt the journey by sea and paying millions to people smugglers along the way. ,39,TimOfAltona
36,"Clive Palmer survives from one stunt to the next - beneath all the bluff and bluster he will always support LNP over Labor , although he's convinced/conned a fair few of the Labor cheer squad that he's on their side and many have fallen for it hook line and sinker. ",51,TimOfAltona
37,"I have a brillaint solution - let's shut down the people smugglers, stop the boats departing Indonesia in the first place, empty out and close down the off shore processing centres (like before), process all those in onshore processing centres then shut them down too (like before) and then everyone wins! ",52,TimOfAltona
38,"No more overcrowded processing centres on or off shore, no more men women and children hopelessly drowning at sea, reduce Australia's debt by billions of dollars, have an orderly and controlled asylum migration program that welcomes and provides the support for genuine refugees through the UNHCR program and no more First Dog cartoons attacking the government with click bait cartoons on this issue! ",64,TimOfAltona
39,"Actually we are both right - true, it was initiated under the Howard government in 2002 and Australia committed to the first order of 14 aircraft under the Rudd Labor government of 2009.",33,TimOfAltona
40,Yes you are spot on. Australia did not have the ship building infrastructure to embark on such a massive project - the cost to establish the infrastructure would have blown out the cost of the project by billions for the same result in the end.,45,TimOfAltona
41,It was the Labor government who did the evaluation and placed the order for these - the incoming government simply fulfilled the order - it was all in the timing. ,31,TimOfAltona
42,"PS - the aircraft have had some teething issues, but are far superior to any other military aircraft in our region and will serve the nation well - good on Labor and the Coalition for the foresight to get this going.",41,TimOfAltona
43,I'm with you - the boats have all but stopped - let's clear out the off shore processing centres by either voluntary or forced repatriation to country of origin for the economic asylum seekers or relocating to a third country for resettlement for the genuine ones and do it as fast as possible so we return to the status quo of the Howard years (before Labor came along a mucked it up),72,TimOfAltona
44,"That's fine, but we need to ensure we have the infrastructure and support services to handle large numbers each year - no point in bringing these people in if they end up being consigned to some kind of migrant ghetto with everyone living off welfare, unemployed and no prospects to build a better life. ",55,TimOfAltona
45,"You only have to look at some suburbs in Paris, Athens, Frankfurt, Naples or London to see what happens when migration gets out of control - oh and for god's sake - don't encourage any increased intake to arrive by people smuggling boats.",43,TimOfAltona
46,"You don't understand - these boats leave Indonesia or Sri Lanka with plenty of people both at the departure point and arrival point (Australia) who know who is on board, when they left, when they should arrive and also have contact with the refugee advocates in Australia. If a boat simply disappears the alarm will be raised including through the media. ",62,TimOfAltona
47,"They are, but economic migrants should enter the country through the correct migration channels like thousands of others do - not pay people smugglers to illegally enter Australia by boats from Indonesia.",32,TimOfAltona
48,Suggest any Brits tuning in also read comments in some other Australian newspapers to learn that this small but vocal (in the Guardian at least) left wing mob are in the minority.,32,TimOfAltona
49,If you want to start submitting complete and utter nonsense better be prepared to back it up - let's have this list of technologies developed tens of thousands of years before European settlement. ,34,TimOfAltona
50,"Funny how many people would rather not be here at all and would rather see Australia in 2014 back to where it was pre-colonisation in the 1700's, inhabited only by hunting and gathering indigenous people. ",36,TimOfAltona
51,"Abbott was referring to the contribution Britain made to establishing infrastructure, trade and investment in Australia when they arrived in the 1700's. He was not having a go at the indigenous people.",32,TimOfAltona
52,It would be being a tad disingenuous to suggest that Australia had existing infrastructure and global trade before the Brits arrived in the 1700's - the only point Abbott is making.,31,TimOfAltona
53,If you don't like what the government has achieved by late 2016 you can go and cast your vote and if the government has not been good enough or lived up to expectations and the consensus by the majority of Australians is that Labor/Greens parties have their act together the government will change. ,54,TimOfAltona
54,"Can't see any problem with the point he is making - In the 17th &amp; 18th century Britain colonised and then built infrastructure and trade in many under developed countries which had an indigenous population, Australia and NZ included, as did the French, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish. ",48,TimOfAltona
55,Kind of balances the books in a funny sort of way because we in Australia had to endure John McTernan from UK Labour as the chief strategist trying to keep Labor's Australian PM Julia Gillard in power. He resorted to plenty of subterfuge to try and prop Gillard up.,49,TimOfAltona
56,"Ian, I respect your point of view but the fact remains you cannot have uncontrolled migration across borders, particularly maritime borders without suffering the same horrific consequences you see in Europe today. The Abbott government policies enjoy a fair amount of support from countries in Europe who are suffering the massive social and financial cost of uncontrolled borders and migration. ",61,TimOfAltona
57,"As you well know, Rudd dismantled Howard's border protection policy and as you well know the result was a massive surge of people trying to reach Australia with onshore detention centres popping up all over the country and then were bursting at the seams and all the problems, riots etc, associated with that. The boats kept coming and coming, Indonesian and Pakistani people smugglers were turning into millionaires, people were regularly drowning at sea and Labor's popularity hit rock bottom. ",81,TimOfAltona
58,"Are we all happy with how they have gone about it? No. But it is working. The incentive to try to reach Australia by boat has been largely removed, the offshore &amp; onshore detention centres will be closed down (as they were under Howard) and Australia can enjoy an orderly and controlled refugee intake program which welcomes and assimilates thousands of genuine refugees each year.",65,TimOfAltona
59,1. Those who were pissed off that the coalition used this topic to win the last election and desperately want the policy to fail- just so they can say Abbott deceived Australia. It tears them apart that the scoreboard looks like this - ,44,TimOfAltona
60,2. Those who actually agree that the government has done a great job in shutting down people smugglers and preventing deaths at sea but have to maintain a confected attack on the government in order to 'stay in the circle'of their fellow Labor/Greens cheer squadders ,46,TimOfAltona
61,3. The bitter and twisted 'I'm on a mission' group - those who have since 9pm Sept 7 last year constantly attacked the PM and the government on anything and everything that arises as 'payback' for their large election loss. This grouping are easy to identify. ,47,TimOfAltona
62,"4. Those who genuinely believe that Australia should open up our borders and welcome and financially support anyone and everyone who can make it here by any means and claim asylum, even if it means hundreds of thousands attempt the journey each year. All offshore processing stopped and everyone can freely enter the community on arrival. This group turns a blind eye when the inevitable deaths at sea occur and pretend they did not happen. Greens? ",77,TimOfAltona
63,5. Those who have  empathy (not a politically motivated one) for the plight of the asylum seekers who try to come here by boat and want/expect the government to treat them with compassion and dignity within the framework of the existing policy. ,44,TimOfAltona
64,"Please enlighten us as to who would be replacing the government - the hapless, directionless, leaderless ALP; the increasingly irrelevant Greens or perhaps you are a PUP supporter? Can't really see any of those three up to the job now or in 2.5 years time IMHO.",46,TimOfAltona
65,We have a generous asylum migration program in place allowing thousands of displaced people to start a new life in Australia by going through the correct channels and being welcomed by the Australian community. ,35,TimOfAltona
66,There is no truth to the rumour that the Senate dress code had to be amended to cater for some of the newly elected cross bench senators -  ,30,TimOfAltona
67,"Ian, this one has been thrashed over and over again for months - it is not illegal to seek asylum but it is illegal to enter Australia on people smuggling boats without visas or identification, hence they are detained in processing centers if they can make it here without drowning along the way. ",54,TimOfAltona
68,"No, those coming by illegal boats and did not drown along the way would have been sent to Manus or Nauru where they would have been processed and settled in a third safe country.  ",36,TimOfAltona
69,"These people did not set off from Sri Lanka - they set off from Southern India where there is no Tamil persecution. True, many Sri Lankan Tamils live in camps, but they are safe to go about their business and earn a living for themselves and their families. The Tamil governer of Tamil Nadu is moving towards granting all Sri Lankan Tamil refugees Indian citizenship. ",66,TimOfAltona
70,We should note that  person on that boat was assessed as having a case to apply for refugee status and was given the opportunity to stay with Australian authorities &amp; have their case processed in Nauru or Manus - that person elected to return to Sri Lanka. ,49,TimOfAltona
71,Makes you wonder what marketing material is being used by people smugglers to entice people onto these boats - refugee advocate Ian Rintoul seems to be across what's going on here given people from the boats are in contact with him while they are at sea. ,47,TimOfAltona
72,Good to see the government holding firm on it's resolve and commitment to maintain border security to deter people smuggling operations. The people on board went through the accepted screening process and have been returned to their country of origin. ,41,TimOfAltona
73,"Remember, these people departed the relatively prosperous Tamil state of Tamil Nadu in Southern India home to tens of millions of Tamils - one could easily reach the assumption they were heading to Australia not to escape persecution but for economic reasons. This aspect would have formed part of the screening process and the decision to return them to their homeland. ",62,TimOfAltona
74,The lefties just hate the thought the Coalition have been successful where Labor failed dismally particularly as it was a key election issue - and Morrison successfully did the job Labor were incapable of. ,35,TimOfAltona
75,"Not a bad summation at all Katharine - the ball is fairly and squarely in the government's court now to turn around the polls and public perception they have moved too quickly on fiscal reform and left reasonably large swarths of the community behind. They have plenty of time to achieve this, but need to be seen to be heading in this direction. ",64,TimOfAltona
76,"As for Labor, well as you say Bill can't believe his luck - here they were expecting to be in opposition for at least another term or two and suddenly he gets a sniff which will embolden him to try and start acting all statesman like. Can he pull it off? Unlikely - way too much ALP civil war baggage around his neck in my opinion. Labor will need to resolve their leadership conundrum, the perception they are tied to the bootlaces of the unions and their love/hate relationship with the Greens before they are ready to take back government. ",101,TimOfAltona
77,"So you would prefer our elected government does nothing - simply allows people to come and go as they please - this is no fear campaign, international terrorism is a constant threat.",32,TimOfAltona
78,"Shorten will never be a PM - you know it, I know it and pretty much the rest of Australia knows it - except maybe a few hopefuls down at the CFMEU.",32,TimOfAltona
79,This is one left wing journo's opinion - many people disagree with him and applaud the government's success in shutting down the people smuggling trade and saving countless lives along the way.,32,TimOfAltona
80,"By all accounts the Tamil tigers gave as good as they got and by some reports more - not defending the Sri Lankan government, but it was hardly a one-way street as you make out - atrocities and human rights abuses were committed by both sides.",46,TimOfAltona
81,"Sarah Hanson-Young - wants everyone who claims to seek asylum automatic entry - hell, the Greens will even charter a flotilla of luxury passenger liners to go to Indonesia and empty out all the camps and bring everyone back to Australia - that's who.",44,TimOfAltona
82,"Good to see Alan Jones still dominating Sydney airwaves. Like him or loath him, he does not hold back on his views and Sydney siders embrace him for it. ",30,TimOfAltona
83,"Yep, disagreed when he dumped Steve Bracks for the NY Consul General post last Sept - should have left Bracksy in the role, he would have done a fine job. ",31,TimOfAltona
84,"Also, disagree when he and other ministers use the term 'mandate'. That word is sure to rile anyone opposed to the policy and is easily shot down in flames. No government has a mandate on anything unless there is a referendum held on a particular issue. ",47,TimOfAltona
85,Funny thing about all this is had Muir gone the other way on Arena they would be attacking him with grubby and offensive remarks not unlike the ones they bestow on the PM. ,34,TimOfAltona
86,"In the greatest traditions of Australian Labor, where Julia Gillard was not allowed to speak unless John McTernan pre-scripted her - who is scripting Muir? He sure as hell ain't coming up with this stuff all by himself. ",39,TimOfAltona
87,They use any platform to throw confected punches at the PM and government - they are all desperately trying to link Tony Abbott to Japan's atrocities during WWII - fail.,30,TimOfAltona
88,Mock professor Sloan at your leftist peril. I put it to you she knows a tad more about economic matters than your good self - your problem is she is not on 'your side' so you endeavor to take her down in the finest traditions of the Labor/Greens cheer squad.,50,TimOfAltona
89,"Your point is valid, however there is another very sad side to this equation which is overlooked - how about start posting the photographs of the hundreds of 'Ferminas' who have drowned at sea coming to Australia on people smuggler boats? ",42,TimOfAltona
90," Where are the cries of 'never again will we allow men, women and children to die at sea in their hundreds whilst travelling to Australia in people smuggler boats'? ",31,TimOfAltona
91,The Greens and the lefties using this topic to try and land blows on the government need to take a good look at themselves and at least acknowledge that the government's policies have saved possibly countless lives.,37,TimOfAltona
92,That has to be one of the worst pieces of journalism we've seen in recent times -I bet Andrew Street mulled over whether or not to include such a weak attempt at humour into the narrative or not - unfortunately for him he included it.,45,TimOfAltona
93,Can't understand why the cheer squad are fawning all over him - as though he is the great messiah who can land blows on the Abbott government on their behalf?  ,32,TimOfAltona
94,Clive can enjoy his 5 minutes of soaking up the adulation from an adoring Labor/Greens cheer squad but a word of warning Clive - as soon as you revert to your conservative roots and herd your cabal of senators into the blue corner the Labor/Greens supporters will start tearing you apart in these threads...it won't be a pretty sight.,59,TimOfAltona
95,"Longers, I deeply respect your views and compassion when it comes to Australian diggers and the atrocities they experienced at the hands of the Japanese in WWII - my father fought the Japanese advance whilst serving as an officer with the 10th Ghurka Rifles in the jungles of Burma and I assure you I can well relate to some of the horror stories coming out of that period - but mate, it was a long time ago and the world really has moved on - using Abe's visit to Australia as a platform to knock Abbott over Japan in WWII is drawing a very long bow - Abbott has said no more or no less than any other Australian PM, Labor or Liberal since the end of the war - Abe's grandfather was Japan's PM after the war and was warmly welcomed in Australia even back then. I think in 2014 it is well and truly time to move on.",160,TimOfAltona
96,"Bit rich coming from a person who will never be a Foreign Affairs minister to person who is a serving Foreign Affairs minister - with the greatest of respect to Ms Plibersek, she knows stuff all about international politics and relationships. ",42,TimOfAltona
97,"Let the Labor/Greens cheer squad enjoy the moment, but this charade will all end in tears for Clive and his PUP puppet senators - what's the betting the senators are around longer in politics than Clive?",36,TimOfAltona
98,Any genuine asylum seekers ie fleeing persecution or worse (hard to imagine given they came from Tamil Nadu) can go to Manus or Nauru for processing and resettlement in a third country or voluntarily return to their prosperous Tamil state in India. ,43,TimOfAltona
99,I read recently that the Tamil governer of Tamil Nadu is moving towards granting Indian citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils relocating to Southern India - this gives them the same rights for them and their families to work and ability to start businesses etc.,44,TimOfAltona
100,Your point about bias against the Japanese is valid - probably because the Scandinavian countries don't hunt and kill their whales in or near Australian waters - out of sight out of mind so to speak.,36,TimOfAltona
101,Time to finally accept that your side has lost this debate. Australians are backing Morrison and his achievements in shutting down the people smugglers and stopping drownings in their tracks. ,31,TimOfAltona
102,"Tough for you I know, but rest assured that the off shore detention centres will one day be empty and shut down - Christmas Island as well - as much as that disturbs you to see a major government win, it is a good thing for everyone involved. ",49,TimOfAltona
103,The Global Times do not represent the views of the Chinese government cheer squadders - it is a column by a journalist from this chinese media outlet expressing his opinion. The Global Times write critical stories about many governments around the world including in the past the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd debacles. ,50,TimOfAltona
104,Good to see the Coalition and PUP look like finally getting this carbon tax repealed whilst putting the Labor/Greens senate team back in their kennels where they deservedly belong. ,30,TimOfAltona
105,Valid observation - but my contention is that had Murdoch backed Gillard &amp;/or Rudd ot let's just say the ALP over the Coalition and irrespective of the election outcome these threads about Murdoch would be almost void of any criticism or the swarth of grubby remarks you see in here today. ,52,TimOfAltona
106,Murdoch was not responsible for the ALP losing last September - nor was Tony Abbott - Labor themselves were to blame as per the findings of the recent ALP internal review of last year's defeat. ,36,TimOfAltona
107,"I agree, we only want media owned/controlled by left wing organisations in this country - that way we can all enjoy a few rousing bars of while we munch on our morning weetbix whilst looking up at the mandatory portrait of the ALP leader on the kitchen wall. ",49,TimOfAltona
108,But seriously - it matters not who owns Australian media - they will still call out a bad government when it is a bad government - and at any examination the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd governments were hopelessly dysfunctional and the ALP paid the price.,42,TimOfAltona
109,He's spot on about the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd civil wars government - all Australia knows it was a dysfunctional rabble during those years (with a few exceptions) and was deservedly shown the door to opposition where they shall remain for at least another 2 terms. ,44,TimOfAltona
110,The sooner the Labor/Greens cheer squad acknowledge they were backing the wrong horse and move on to try and rebuild their shattered parties the better off they and their respective parties will be.,33,TimOfAltona
111,Of course the Labor/Greens cheer squad will attack anything to do with Murdoch - for he did not back their team last year when they lost in spectacular fashion. ,30,TimOfAltona
112,Bottom line here is that Campbell is leading an operation that has successfully shut down the insidious people smuggling trade perhaps saving hundreds or thousands of souls from drowning. Campbell enjoys the support of millions of Australians. ,38,TimOfAltona
113,Can't for the life of me understand why the Labor/Greens supporters denounce that - I don't for a moment think they would rather see people drowning at sea - but I would like just one of them to explain how else do you stop people drowning at sea in people smuggler boats apart from stopping the boats leaving in the first place? ,63,TimOfAltona
114,Here I was thinking 'Centreline' would be the first cheer squadder to admit that lives have been saved - but no - can't bring himself to do it - that would look too much like acknowledging the success of the government and that would  do in a Guardian thread.,50,TimOfAltona
115,He has done an excellent job in shutting down the people smugglers and saving countless lives - a pity he was not around when people were drowning in their hundreds after the Rudd Labor government started up the people smuggling trade again and carried on under the Gillard Labor/Greens government. ,51,TimOfAltona
116,"I know many left wing supporters don't like to see the success of Operation Sovereign Borders but I live for the day when  of the cheer squad admit that maybe, just maybe lives have been saved since boats stopped departing Indonesia and that is wholly a good thing. ",50,TimOfAltona
117,"33,000 feet in the air is hardly in a war zone and dozens of commercial planes follow the same flight path between Asia and Europe each day. Who would have guessed the Russians had handed over sophisticated surface to air missiles to allow the separatists to shoot down planes? ",50,TimOfAltona
118,Grubby personal comments aimed at a person's appearance means you instantly lose the argument. It means you have nothing left in your locker except personal abuse. Sums up many of the Labor/Greens cheer squad unfortunately.,35,TimOfAltona
119,The stupidity of all this is it is the left wing refugee advocates who are prolonging the wait at sea for these peole while they try to force through the High Court for Australia to take them. ,38,TimOfAltona
120,These people would be far better off returning to the freedom of Tamil Nadu than being forced to go into the off shore detention centres that the Greens seem intent on sending them to.,34,TimOfAltona
121,I see that Tamil Governer Rosahiah of this state is working on giving Sri Lankan Tamil refugees Indian citizenship to assist with their integration with the 70 odd million Tamil speaking citizens of this prosperous Indian state.,37,TimOfAltona
122,Why is it that the Labor opposition constantly undermines the government at every possible opportunity? They may have different ideas but this is unprofessional behaviour that would be unacceptable in any other workplace. ,34,TimOfAltona
123,LOL - the Australian Labor/Greens cheer squad desperately concerned the PM will come out of this with an enhanced global reputation and he and Bishop may actually be credited with bringing our dead home - sleepless nights ahead for the cheer squad as they grapple with this awkward situation they find themselves in. ,54,TimOfAltona
124,Abbott and Bishop are doing what we expect the Australian government do - it may irk the Labor/Greens cheer squad that they are making progress &amp; receiving recognition on the world stage - but bottom line is we want the dead home and we want them home now. ,49,TimOfAltona
125,For the people not from Australia reading this blog 'Yamba' is part of a group called the Labor/Greens cheer squad who infect the Guardian threads with grubby comments against the Australian government as payback for the devastating loss their political party experienced last year - nearly wiped out - so this is part of their campaign of vilification and retribution. ,61,TimOfAltona
126,The government can safely adopt the Hockey sponsored productivity report final recommendations once they come out later this year which will probably see a watering down of the paid parental scheme and funds channelled into early childhood reform. ,39,TimOfAltona
127,Sussan Ley is a class operator and correct when she says this is a once in a generation opportunity for reform. I would expect the government to adopt most if not all of the final recommendations later this year. ,40,TimOfAltona
128,A good friend friend of mine who lives in QLD tells me Newman has tried to do too much too quickly - changing the world overnight and he has managed to leave some people behind with some decisions. I suspect he will slow down the pace of change to better reflect community expectations. ,54,TimOfAltona
129,Time for the Labor/Greens cheer squad to take stock of their crass insensitivity to people dying and being killed just so they can try and land confected blows against the government. ,32,TimOfAltona
130,Read some of the posts from your mob in this thread attacking Abbott for doing the job he should as PM over this tragedy and then come back to us with an apology.,33,TimOfAltona
131,Good to see Abbott taking a world leadership position on pressuring Russia to allow access to the crash site. Abbott and Bishop are leading the charge on behalf of the relatives of the murdered Australians as well as all the other nationalities - exactly what we expect of our PM. ,51,TimOfAltona
132,"Can't see that happening myself, still over 2 years to go before the next election and plenty of time for the polls to turn around which they undoubtedly will as Abbott's policies gain traction and Labor's mismanagement of our economy is reversed by the new government. ",47,TimOfAltona
133,"What a load of crap. Your greatest fear is that Abbott gets the recognition he deserves for doing all he can to bring the dead Australians' home - you put your cheap political point scoring ahead of the deaths of Australian men, women and children and the grieving of their relatives.

144,The current group on board the customs vessel did not have a man with a gun at their head when they departed for Australia. They came from the relatively prosperous Tamil state in Southern India. They were not escaping fearing for their lives or escaping persecution - 70 million people live happily in Tamil Naidu... they were coming to Australia hoping to tap into our welfare system and perhaps get a job and perhaps give their families a better head start in life - there are tens of millions queued up behind them wanting to do the same thing.,99,TimOfAltona

146,"Yes - people smugglers do exist in the  world and yes, people hoping to bypass the UNHCR program and get to Australia by illegal boat do pay people smugglers for the service. ",34,TimOfAltona
147,"The people 'crewing' the boats are not the people smugglers - they are being paid by the people smugglers to do the job - the people smugglers have made millions of dollars and a % of this goes to the corrupt police, military and assorted Indonesian government officials who are also on the payroll to facilitate the safe departure of the boats from Indonesia. ",65,TimOfAltona
148,"Also, many of the people paying people smugglers are not genuine asylum seekers - they are economic migrants looking to tap into Australia's welfare system and with any luck get a job here. ",34,TimOfAltona
149,"You pretty much have to go back to the Labor government under Kevin Rudd that opened up our borders and got the people smuggling industry back on it's feet. Tens of thousands of people climbed into people smuggler boats and headed for Australia, many hundreds drowning along the way. ",50,TimOfAltona
150,"The new government came in to fix up Labor's mess and is making good progress - the ultimate aim is to close down all processing centres, on and off shore. This will be achieved by stopping the boats - so far so good on that front - much to the annoyance of the Labor cheer squad who wanted the boats to keep arriving just so they could come into the Guardian threads and proclaim yet another Abbott promise broken. Good to see that little piece of enjoyment has been denied. ",91,TimOfAltona
151,Thank you Longers - at last a Labor supporter who acknowledges that the government is doing the right thing in it's efforts to bring our dead home to their families. ,31,TimOfAltona
152,"Pretty much all the other's are attacking Abbott and Bishop with confected abuse over the handling and response to the tragedy. I guess their key issue is that they want it to be a  PM doing all this, not a Liberal and they can't bring themselves to acknowledge that Abbott and co have done a bloody good job so far in doing everything we can to help the families and bring their deceased loved ones home. ",78,TimOfAltona
153,"Funny thing is though, you have to stop the boats to achieve that - otherwise, as we saw under Labor, the detention centres keep on filling up, even having to open up new ones to cope with the thousands arriving by boat each month. ",45,TimOfAltona
154,"Now come clean with the Australian people Crowey - you know as well as all of us here that had Abbott left the country to attend a meeting in Palau, you and the rest of the cheer squad would be up in arms attacking him for running away and leaving the the families of the victims of MH17. ",59,TimOfAltona
155,"Best to give up on your attacks over Abbott and MH17 - he is doing what we expect the Australian PM, Labor or Liberal, to be doing and that is firstly - doing everything humanly possible to help the families &amp; to bring their loved ones home and secondly doing all the Australian government can to to assist in bringing the perpetrators to justice. ",65,TimOfAltona
156,Some events transcend domestic politics and this is one of them - follow the lead of your Labor party who have thrown their weight behind Abbott to help him get this job done.,33,TimOfAltona
157,"I think the Labor supporters give Murdoch way too much credit - whilst he was a useful distraction for them away from their internal disunity and dysfunction - I suspect he holds little if any sway over Australian domestic politics. Ask former PM's Rudd and Gillard, they 'consulted' with Murdoch over dinners and lunches whenever they were in NY - I doubt they would support the conspiracy theorists active in these threads today (aka Labor cheer squad) that Murdoch influenced them one way or the other. ",87,TimOfAltona
158,"Who cares if Abbott discussed the PPL with Murdoch over dinner, he probably discussed a lot of things going on at the time - the PPL scheme was on Abbott's radar years before any dinner with Murdoch - it was out in the public domain back in 2010.",48,TimOfAltona
159,"They all beat a path to Murdoch's door when they to NY- Hawke, Howard, Rudd, Gillard, Abbott all have lunches and dinners with the News Corp chairman. Shorten will be working his way to meeting him as soon as he can swing it - if he holds onto the leadership that is.",52,TimOfAltona
160,The truth can be hurtful at times...we have all been there. Don't give up though - there  a place for Labor - it's just that this is not the time.,31,TimOfAltona
161,"Most are living in denial that Murdoch was calling a bad government for what it was, a bad government. At any examination the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years were not the best for Labor - dysfunction, back stabbing and leaks were a daily occurrence. ",42,TimOfAltona
162,Even the ALP's internal report on last year's election failure stated it was down to internal dysfunction fueled by intense and very public rivalry between the Gillard and Rudd camps. ,31,TimOfAltona
163,"The ALP's current leader, Shorten, was a key player/contributor to all the unfolding dramas and has, thanks to the unions, been rewarded with a temporary seat at the head of the table. He will not survive in that role if Labor is to have any chance of forming a government in the years ahead. ",55,TimOfAltona

170,But Ian herein lies the problem for Labor - Labor PMs and leaders are seen to be mere puppets for the strongest unions - Gillard is an excellent example. ,30,TimOfAltona
171,Unions are not as relevant to the Australian way of life as they were say 50 or even 30 years ago - in fact unions only represent a small % of the working population. ,35,TimOfAltona
172,This brings into question the whole relevancy of Labor as a political party and we end up with the infighting and back stabbing of the past 6 years - factions fighting for territory for a piece of a rapidly shrinking pie. ,42,TimOfAltona
173,"Shorten is trying his best to reignite the ""Light on the Hill' rhetoric - but this will fall largely on deaf ears - Australia has moved on from all that working class romanticism crap largely because so many more of us are much better off than we were 20 or 30 years ago. ",54,TimOfAltona
174,"Shame the cheer squad can't throw their support behind Abbott and Bishop's efforts to bring our dead Australians home to their families - in fact they are outright criticising them for doing what we expect them to be doing and achieving. From what I see and hear, the PM is being praised around the globe for his leadership achievements after the tragedy. ",63,TimOfAltona
175,Abbott has been surviving off minimal sleep since the MH17 disaster - he has been working during different time zones to discuss/coordinate the situation with various world leaders and our team on the ground - typically Europe between 2 and 4 in the morning and then going on to do a full days work. You choose to comment on his eyes as 'evil'. Try tired comrade.,66,TimOfAltona
176, is why Labor are out of office for the next 2-3 terms - the disconnect from reality blinds their judgement to the point that they live in a parallel universe from mainstream Australia.,34,TimOfAltona

181,HaHaHaHaHa Daisy - that is so coming from a long time member of the Labor/Greens cheer squad who between them spend hours on the Guardian threads each day writing hundreds of grubby and vilifying comments about Tony Abbott. ,39,TimOfAltona
182,"Exactly - I have been saying this for some time but keep on being shot down in flames by the Labor cheer squad....seriously, if Labor are to have any hope of forming government over the next 6-9 years they need to refocus on reform - Labor and their supporters banging on about the evil Tony Abbott &amp; hoping that will be enough to get them over the line is pure delusion and will ensure they stay in opposition for years to come.",82,TimOfAltona

192,The left are on the wrong side of public opinion on this one and lost the argument a long time ago...this government is to be congratulated for delivering on what they promised and what we voted for last September. Labor were just not up to the task...how many PM's did they go through and how many Immigration ministers did Labor churn through - was it 5 or 6? None of them up to the task - all failures. ,79,TimOfAltona

It is the right thing to do to bring them ashore temporarily until the High Court judgement is handed down and then they can either be returned to Tamil southern India or over to Manus or Nauru for processing. It is fairly likely these are economic migrants simply looking to improve their lives in Australia so either they return to India or their original homeland. Those determined to be  refugees can be resettled in a third country such as PNG, Nauru or Cambodia. ",101,TimOfAltona
198,You seem to be confused .the police are there for security dutiescrash investigators and forensic teams will be doing the work on the wreckage and human remains. The police are there because it would be too problematic for ADF or any troops from any country to be on the ground in that situation. ,54,TimOfAltona
199,Julie Bishop and her Dutch counterpart are making good progress in Kiev to bring this about with Ukrainian authorities whilst Abbott is dealing with Putin on the Russian side to allow unrestricted access for the multi-national police contingent to provide security whilst the forensic and recovery teams do their vital work. ,52,TimOfAltona
200,"Correct, the same occurred in 9/11. The key to this is forensic examination of the various crash sites to occur as quickly as possible before too much evidence or remains are lost...hence the government pushing for a security team to assist with this process.",44,TimOfAltona

213,What a load of crap - Gillard was the most detested PM in a generation - had she gone on to lead Labor to the election they would have been lucky to come away with 30 seats in the lower house - such was the feeling of animosity towards her - not only from mainstream Australia but within her own party. The only reason her and Combet were bosom buddies was because they were both marionettes for the powerful unions who dictated ALP policy through the PM placed into office.. ,91,TimOfAltona
214,The 'Gillard' experiment crashed and burned for Labor and they will never ever repeat that mistakenot if they ever want to return to government in this country. Gillard was a disaster - nearly destroyed her own party.,37,TimOfAltona

224, the polls have transformed from being highly dubious and a totally unreliable tool of a giant media conspiracy against Labor into a highly credible and accurate source of how voters feel about the government. ,36,TimOfAltona
225,Don't worry about that comment - it's the Labor/greens cheer squad worried that the PM may look good for what he's done following the tragedy - they can't stand the thought that he may actually have made a major contribution to bringing our dead home and will receive praise for it - none the least from the relatives of those tragically killed.,62,TimOfAltona

312,Here's a useful tip though - I think you will find a fair few Labor/Greens cheer squad members supporting you as anyone Abbott criticizes is immediately befriended by the cheer squad as one of their own -it's just the way it goes.,42,TimOfAltona

360,Shhhhhh...don't mention that to the Labor/Greens cheer squad... they have duped themselves into thinking that a Labor/Greens government will just flop over the line in 2016 without doing or saying anything...albeit releasing a couple of policies at around 5pm the night before the polling day.,45,TimOfAltona
361,Nice try by the Labor/Greens cheer squad trying to link Palmer's comments to the Abbott government - falls on deaf ears though - Palmer is clearly 'out there' at the moment and is buddying up to Labor to try and block Budget elements in the senate. ,47,TimOfAltona

375,"I hear your point, but I doubt IS fighters have much interest on who is the PM or which political party is in power in Australia while they go about their jihad - this same situation could have easily arisen when Labor were in government and Labor would be grappling with the same conundrum.  ",56,TimOfAltona
376,I think we all saw Gillian Triggs over-reach with some of her comments made to the Minister on Friday - prisons and armed guards. It was unfortunate because it was echoing a Sarah Hanson-Young type of rhetoric which tends to fall on deaf ears with the majority of the electorate. ,51,TimOfAltona
377,Triggs would have been better to stick with the facts without resorting to inaccurate or misleading statements (perhaps she genuinely believed the processing centre staff carried guns?) but as Chair she should have better informed herself. ,37,TimOfAltona

381,"I think the reality is also that Labor have been very uninspiring and highly unconvincing in their arguments against the budget - apart from promising to increase spending, axe the proposed savings and (by definition) create billions of dollars in additional debt if they were in government, we have seen little or nothing from them on how they would fix up their mess of the past 6 years.

384,Why do the Labor/Greens cheer squad always resort to childish name calling - to me it looks like they have lost the argument &amp; have nothing left but the antics you see more commonly in primary school children. This gives me great comfort that the Labor/Greens party will occupy the opposition benches for many years to come. IMHO.,58,TimOfAltona
385,The point I make is that there is a world of difference between armed and non-armed guards - particularly in these facilities. Triggs was wrong to assert that there are armed guards in the detention centres - there are not and never have been. Facts are facts.,47,TimOfAltona

398,"Just so happens that right now 99.9999% of the IS jihadists rampaging through Iraq and Syria are Sunni Muslims or those who have converted to Sunni Islam and Sharia law, so it makes pretty good sense to have dialogue with the various Muslim groups represented in Australia. ",48,TimOfAltona

406,"While the majority of Australians are happy to see this country lend a hand to stop both the ISIS advance and the protection of minority communities, it seems the Labor/Greens cheer squad's primary area of concern ahead of the slaughter in Iraq is that the Abbott government may actually look good for helping prevent genocide and how many votes that may translate to in late 2016.",66,TimOfAltona
407,Funny how Abbott and Shorten are essentially saying the same things in relation to this humanitarian disaster but the Labor/Greens cheer squad focus their attack on Abbott but completely ignore Shorten's almost identical comments - it's as if Shorten does not even exist any more or is completely irrelevant in this discourse - I pick the latter.,57,TimOfAltona

414,Part of Joyce's problem is that he came from a low cost airline background firstly in Europe and then Jetstar. I just don't think he transitioned well into the full service environment that was QF. He may have been better to remain heading up Jetstar and reporting into the QF CEO.,51,TimOfAltona

416,Qantas used to be on par with the big global airlines but have definitely dropped a few notches over the past 10 years - I think it's a mix of bad management and complacency. I would rate the attitude of QF cabin crew on par with that of the larger US airlines - which means it just ain't that good. ,61,TimOfAltona
417,Tony Sheldon is spot on when he says that Qantas need to change their CEO if they want to recover from this. Joyce has been a failure through and through and the QF Board (who recruited Joyce over Borghetti) are also to blame for this result.,46,TimOfAltona

This is the only state presiding over a budget surplus (despite Labor's disasterous white elephant desal plant) and this fact alone should be enough to get the Libs across the line. Labor is just too risky.,51,TimOfAltona

445,Gillard may have been a very personable individual - but she was the most loathed PM Labor have ever experimented with - she was on track to nearly wipe out her own party at the election had she not been taken down by Shorten and thrown out of office. ,50,TimOfAltona
446,Unlikely - they will continue to thrash around in the political wilderness searching for purpose and leadership for the next few years....of course they will at some point regain government in this country but that time is a long way off...perhaps another 3 terms or more. How many leaders do you think they will churn through until they come up with a winner? ,64,TimOfAltona

",95,TimOfAltona
455,Labor are still years away from rebuilding their shattered party and still quite a way to go to sort out their leadership problems and the ongoing civil war between the left and right of the party. They also need to work out a way they can rebuild and move forward without having to rely on their Greens partners to get them over the line. There will need to be at least another two changes of leadership in Labor and Milne will have to also be gone from the Greens before Labor look anything like an alternative government.

The indicators are there now. ",67,TimOfAltona

482,"Successive governments, Labor, Liberal, state and federal have collectively poured  of dollars of 'funding' into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities - building houses, schools, community centres, recreation facilities, drug and alcohol abuse programs, anti-sexual assault programs, homelessness support, adult education/training and employment programs - all designed to support and assist these Australian communities in rural and urban areas.

483,It's an old cliche I know but the old adage that the people smugglers never had a better friend than in the Australian Greens who will provide them with a viable business model if they ever got into government or took control again of Labor policies.,46,TimOfAltona

488,"You see, people won't trust another Labor/Greens government so soon - particularly with all the Labor leadership dysfunction still swirling around and the ALP grappling with it's defacto marriage with the Greens ( do they split or do they still cuddle up with each other in bed?)  the overall future direction of the ALP still up in the air after the crash and burn of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd experiments. ",70,TimOfAltona
489,"What a sad and sorry bunch the Labor/Greens cheer squad are these days - first they criticise him for not going up there, then they criticise for being up there (wasting taxpayers money &amp; running the country from a tent) and now they criticise him for perhaps returning early due to events in the Middle East. ",57,TimOfAltona
490,So in your view the PM should go up there but have no contact with the people he is visiting just in case a photographer captures the moment and the PM is portrayed favourably in the image? ,38,TimOfAltona
491,Bottom line is you have no bloody idea what discussions the PM had in private with Yolngu elders yet you manufacture your version to denigrate Abbott - unless of course you come back to us and tell us you were sitting down with the PM and the Yolngu elders and heard for yourself what was discussed then your posts may have a little more credibility.,65,TimOfAltona
492,Julie Bishop has actually grown in stature in the job - she has created a very positive image for herself and Australia over her handling of the MH17 disaster and the Iraq crisis. ,34,TimOfAltona

513,"I also add that the accompanying threat by Sinaloa is that they survive not only through killings of competitors but also widespread corruption of police, military and government officials. ",30,TimOfAltona
514,You raise a very good point Daisy - the Sinaloa cartel do represent a real threat to Australia given the atrocities they commit in Mexico funded by billionaire drug bosses. ,31,TimOfAltona
515,The difference between the two groups is that ISIS is all about religion/ideology and seek to destroy those of different beliefs whereas Sinaloa is all about the money and tend to target and kill only those involved in the drug trade - not butchering thousands of innocent men women and children. ,52,TimOfAltona
516,"That was not the question I was responding to... he wanted to know how a dual Australian/Israeli citizen performing military/conscription service with the IDF and being required to enter Gaza, which may be a 'no travel' area given Hamas is a prescribed terrorist organisation would be treated by the proposed new legislation.",52,TimOfAltona
517,IDF are not a prescribed terrorist organisation and are in Gaza as a direct result of a lawful direction from the Israeli government to combat terrorism against the state of Israel.,31,TimOfAltona

539,"By the way - any thoughts on Peter Slippers sentence today? You know, the guy you 'cleverly' drafted into the Speakers position to try and shore up the failing Gillard government's numbers? ",33,TimOfAltona
540,The media called it for what it was - an ineffectual and incompetent PM who was a Labor Party experimental blow-in who crashed and burned and nearly brought her whole god damn party down with her. ,37,TimOfAltona
541,It is such a shame that Australia's first female PM could not have been a person who was firstly voted in by the people and who also had the respect and support of Australians. What we had with Gillard was contempt and loathing.,43,TimOfAltona
542,"This Tony Abbott fellow must be some kind of demi-god - totally responsible for all the evil on this planet - every natural disaster, homicide, genocide, earthquake, famine, wars, pestilence, terrorist attacks, shark attacks, motor vehicle accidents, crime waves, riots, massacres etc etc etc are all down to the Australian PM.",51,TimOfAltona
543,As PM she was largely being scripted by John McTernan - pretty much every media appearance/statement by Gillard had her parroting scripts pre-prepared for her by McTernan - hence the robotic nature of her media appearances. ,37,TimOfAltona
544,The whole misogyny beat up was the brain child of McTernan scratching around for something that would resonate with the female vote and try and lift Gillard's dismal approval rating - he had previously used the same tactic against British PM David Cameron when he was advising the UK Labor party.,51,TimOfAltona
545,"Daisy, he said he would never do deals to ala Julia Gillard. Of course he has to negotiate to get bills passed through senate - it's the normal process when the government of the day does not hold a majority. Abbott will deal with PUP, Greens, Independents and even Labor to get bills passed. ",55,TimOfAltona
546,Naturally the Labor cheer squad then ignore the polls or call them a media conspiracy because they don't want to face up to Labor's inherent weaknesses - of which there are many.,32,TimOfAltona
547,"Labor supporters can argue amongst themselves all they like over whether it was Rudd or Gillard who brought the party to it's knees in the lower house last September , but the 3 key issues still exist that will keep them out of government for the next two terms at least, namely - ",54,TimOfAltona
548,"1. Leadership dysfunction and factional infighting. The ALP go to great lengths to keep a lid on these two corrosive ALP attributes, but they are always just below the surface bubbling away. Disunity is death. ",36,TimOfAltona
549,"2. The stigma of being viewed as nothing more than an extension of the powerful unions, some militant (Gillard was tainted by this). I get that Labor are the political arm of the union movement and all that but you only have to look at the makeup of the Labor senate and you pretty quickly see where all the old union hacks end up. Parachuting into the senate is a favourite pass time for ex-union officials looking for reward for their union stewardship.  ",85,TimOfAltona
550,3. The ALP's reliance on the Greens to both get them into government and then staying in government. You only have to look at what happened across the Tasman last Saturday to see what mainstream voters think of Labor/Greens governments - Australia is no different. Everyone can see that the Greens having helped the ALP then hold them hostage to Greens policies (again - Gillard and the Carbon Tax) and we really don't want to go down that path again. ,81,TimOfAltona
551,"She may have been a good person and all that, but she was totally inept in this role and very nearly lead the ALP to a defeat they may have never recovered from. ",34,TimOfAltona
552,"Rudd, for all his faults did save some of Labor's furniture last September. Had Gillard not been removed by Shorten et al, Labor would have been lucky to be holding 30 seats in this current Parliament such was the loathing Australian voters had for Gillard. ",46,TimOfAltona
553,This woman is a product of Clive Palmer placing newspaper ads in Tasmanian newspapers calling for Tasmanians to apply to join his party as a senate candidate...could be she was the only one who stuck her hand up. ,39,TimOfAltona
554,"What I don't get is how she went on Insiders knowing the discussion/questioning would be about muslims, hijabs and Islam and she had no idea how to describe or explain sharia law when asked by Barry Cassidy - it was a classic Pauline Hanson moment and made her sound totally inept.",51,TimOfAltona
555,He's part of that esteemed group of Guardian commentators who think this whole thing is a conspiracy between ISIS and the Australian government designed to keep the current Australian PM in office.,32,TimOfAltona
556,He's a regular left-wing activist in these threads - attacks anything the conservative Australian government do to stop the terrorism threat through fear that any success in this area will see the current government be re-elected in 2 years time.,40,TimOfAltona
557,"You can't be serious - how many failed Immigration ministers did Labor trawl through over the 6 years not one of them able to achieve what Morrison has in his first year - Boats stopped, detention centres being emptied out and best of all, possibly hundreds of lives saved. ",50,TimOfAltona
558,We all worked out why the Labor/Greens cheer squad don't like Morrison - because he showed Labor up to be the incompetent government they were when it came to border protection and proved to Australian voters that we got it right by voting the Coalition in to fix up Labor's mess and we will all over again in 2016.,59,TimOfAltona
559,Morrison is very good communicator - his performance in parliament is up there with the best. I can see him moving into more senior government portfolios over the next few years.,31,TimOfAltona
560,Abbott actually made a pretty good speech on his UN debut - he had the world's most powerful leaders tuned into his narrative on fighting ISIS - made Australia look very good. ,33,TimOfAltona
561,Watching Abbott presenting at the UN Security Council begs the question - can anyone see the leader of the alternative Australian government sitting at the Security Council table dealing with these critical issues?  ,35,TimOfAltona
562,My advice to the Labor supporters - you had better get a wiggle on and sort out your leadership problems - trying to change leaders too close to the next election guarantees you will remain in the political wilderness for another two terms at least.,45,TimOfAltona
563,Joe does have a lot of fun at Wayne Swan's expense - checking under 'S' in the index of Swanny's book for the word 'Surplus' - no where to be found. ,32,TimOfAltona
564,"Despite what many Labor/Greens supporters contend in these threads, I'm pretty certain that ISIS and the Liberal Party did conspire with each other and arrive at a genocide plan for Iraq and Syria in order to secure Tony Abbott's re-election in 2016. ",43,TimOfAltona
565,"To all the Labor Gillard supporters on here I say this - I'm with you,Gillard should not have been knifed by her own party &amp; replaced by Rudd. She should have stayed on and lead Labor to an even greater crushing defeat last September. ",45,TimOfAltona
566,I hear the book stores have already got it on 50% off a day or two after it's launch - wait another couple of days and it will be in the 90% off bargain bin out the front of Dymocks.,40,TimOfAltona
567,"Andrew, you missed the bit where the rather jovial &amp; harmless looking fellow with the balaclava is randomly raping, shooting, crucifying and beheading men, women and children from christian, Shiite, Kurdish and other assorted minority groups who's only crime is that they happen to be in the way of these terrorists establishing their 'caliphate'.  ",56,TimOfAltona
568,Clearly you disagree with the 'west' trying to stop this genocide - if you are representative of the Labor/Greens cheer squad on this issue then I put it to you that it will be many many years before Labor and Greens will be trusted with governing this country again. ,50,TimOfAltona
569,This is the action of a strong government fixing up a bloody big mess created by Labor ineptitude - starting with Rudd handing the people smugglers a beautifully crafted business model to work with - what we see today is the result of all that. ,46,TimOfAltona
570,Congratulations to Morrison - ultimately the camps at Nauru and Manus will be emptied and shut down and since the boats have stopped arriving they will remain shut......until the next Labor/Greens government get into power and then it starts all over again..,42,TimOfAltona
571,"Milne has dealt herself and her party out of contention for anything in 2016 and Labor are, well...just Labor....hanging onto anything that they think will keep them in touch with the current government...but know deep down they must surely lose Round 2 in 2016.",44,TimOfAltona
572,A poor bloke on his ipad walks through security at the airport and the Labor/Greens cheer squad are calling for the Australian PM to resign because it's all Abbott's fault..  ,32,TimOfAltona
573,A win for the refugees who have the opportunity to start afresh in a safe country which is signatory to the 1951 refugee convention along with financial assistance from Australia ,31,TimOfAltona
574,"A win for Australia because it means the off shore detention centres will in time be emptied &amp; closed (What will the Greens have to complain about then?), the boats have stopped so there are no more people arriving to fill them up (unlike under Labor) and our orderly UNHCR migration program can continue and those genuine refugees and their families can look forward to being welcomed into Australia with open arms and assimilate into our community. ",78,TimOfAltona
575,I suspect you will find a couple of seriously injured policemen in hospital who would disagree that this person's only offence was being a person of interest comrade - oh....and about 20 million Australians as well.,36,TimOfAltona
576,Wrong - Morrison will be our next Defence Minister - Turnbull will possibly replace Abbott when Abbott goes - mind you Julie Bishop is growing in stature here and overseas - don't rule it out.,35,TimOfAltona
577,I guess a country with a population of 15.5m people can absorb a paltry few hundred people - particularly as the Australian government is covering the cost of their resettlement. ,31,TimOfAltona
578,If Labor are to have any chance in 2016 they need to ditch their reliance on the Greens to get them over the line - this is where it all starts to go pear shape because  the Greens Labor can't get the numbers so 2016 will be a choice between the incumbent Coalition and another Labor/Greens cabal. ,59,TimOfAltona
579,Abbott's use of the 'Light on the Hill' analogy was a masterstroke. ALP should be incredibly proud it took a conservative PM to quote Ben Chifley at a UN General Assembly address.  ,34,TimOfAltona
580,"C'mon Ian, you and I both know that is not true. This government has steady hand and we will all emerge from this period in an ok state. Keeping Australia's economy on track is the key to social, economic and political stability. ",43,TimOfAltona
581,"Rest assured, Labor will eventually rebuild, though it is some years off yet, and will once more occupy the Treasury benches (although the leadership &amp; front bench by then will have changed considerably from what we see today). ",39,TimOfAltona
582,"I wouldn't be too hard on Shorten - the Abbott government is showing strong leadership over these issues - Labor has no choice but to stay with the government or else they will end up being perceived, like the Greens, as largely irrelevant when it comes to national security and fighting terrorism - this in turn guarantees successive Coalition governments in power for the next few years. Albo would be doing the same thing if was LOTO in my opinion.",80,TimOfAltona
583,Good comment. The left use that term to try and land blows against the government - in fact it shows up their ignorance - nothing can compare to the abject horrors of WWII concentration camps. ,36,TimOfAltona
584,The situation on Manus or Nauru is far from ideal and eventually these centres will be emptied &amp; closed down (what will the Greens have to complain about then?) but the undeniable fact is that perhaps hundreds of lives have been spared from drowning since the government delivered on it's pre-election promise.why is this fact always ignored/overlooked by the Labor/Greens cheer squad? ,63,TimOfAltona

587,"You are right in that Iraq and Syria is a distraction from domestic politics and it is not only the government that is hidden, but also very much the Labor opposition. I think both sides of politics would prefer we did not have to deal with ISIS.",47,TimOfAltona
588,Funny how the left  see the Abbott government at fault here - but ignore Labor who would be going down the same path if they were in government. ,30,TimOfAltona
589," - In the ""face of evil,"" nations of good conscience do have a responsibility to act.""I reconfirmed to the Prime Minister, Labor's support for this important development.""When it comes to fighting terror, Labor and the government are working together."" ",41,TimOfAltona
590,The families wanted a RC into the circumstances around the deaths of their children to help provide closure and determine the sequence of events that lead to the multiple tragedies.  ,32,TimOfAltona
591,My point is valid - so many Labor/Greens supporters are more concerned about the prospect of a rise in the government's popularity than they are in the genocide occurring on a daily basis in Nth Iraq and Syria. ,39,TimOfAltona
592,"QLD Labor suffers from the same disease inflicting federal Labor - Poor leadership, reliance on disreputable unions and cosying up to the Greens to try and get across the line. ",31,TimOfAltona
593,Labor and their supporters need to seriously look at internal party reform if they are to have any hope over the next few years - confected attacks against Abbott or Newman is not the strategy you need to win back government..,41,TimOfAltona
594,"I'm confused - when Newspoll shows Qld Labor are in front, all the Labor supporters applaud the result as proof that Labor will win the next election and Newman is finished - but when Newspoll shows the Newman government are in front of Labor, according to the Labor supporters (see plenty below), Newspoll is immediately transformed into a Murdoch conspiracy to keep the LNP in government and should be totally disregarded. ",72,TimOfAltona
595,You may be a bit confused - Defence Dept and C'wealth Health have provided that advice to the government...it was not the government's decision. The minister is acting on advice from the experts.,33,TimOfAltona
596,This decision was made by both the Defence Dept and the Commonwealth Health Dept who duly advised the government of the day - I'm fairly certain the same decision would have been forthcoming if it was a Labor government and a Labor government would likewise be heeding the expert advice from Health and Defence.,54,TimOfAltona

Our manufacturing failed recently (cars) but this was mainly due to a sustained mining boom and the consequent rise in the dollar (which floats unlike China's currency).

1439,Some of those unions must be very confused with Labor and their CFMEU focus. The Shoppies for example who lean more to the centre than the left must be flabbergasted by the influence that the the hard core have. Can't say Shorten has managed it well at all.,48,TheJediMaster

1474,The thing that strikes me about Paris next week is that there's no key objective. There's no headline goal (e.g. 30% ERT by 2030) that is being worked towards. Have a look at their website: ,35,TheJediMaster

1647,"I always laugh when someone uses the ""doubled the deficit"" line Daisy. Abbott inherited a deficit of $48 billion. It'd be great if you could talk us through how it's doubled (and that pathetic ABC analysis using Swan's numbers doesn't quite cut it). ",43,TheJediMaster
1648,"Might i suggest you have a read of the budget as it stands. With spending sitting at 25.9%, it's a pretty ignorant suggestion that spending isn't the major cause of the deficit. ",32,TheJediMaster
1649,Good decision Malcolm - revenue is a bit of an issue but spending is a whopping one. He might be wise to use the few months leading up to the budget to educate and convince Australians of the need for serious expenditure cuts.  ,43,TheJediMaster
1650,There seems to be some sort of inbuilt mindset amongst the Premiers that education and health spending need to rise. Why can't we be smarter with what we spend already ? It's not as if there aren't a heap of inefficiencies in the systems at the moment.  ,47,TheJediMaster
1651,"I know it's been condemned by a lot of people but if you look at the return per dollar investment, a lot of what's been achieved through the Direct Action plan is as economically effective as any other scheme it's ever come up with, including regulation or carbon pricing, Dr Finkel said. ",52,TheJediMaster
1652,"That one's easy - removing the carbon tax reduced the input costs for those who rely on energy to run their businesses, which meant they made more money and paid more company tax.  ",33,TheJediMaster

Their failure to properly balance their economies across the region is holding them back.In the U.S, for example, if there's a major piece of infrastructure that needs funding and building, provided it doesn't matter so much where it is, they build it in an economically depressed area in order to revitalise the local economy there. It's a great mechanism: you get something built and the local economy gets a major boost.That doesn't happen in the EU because individual countries still retain their individual interests. The poorer countries in the EU don't need bailouts.

Unlikely, as her drunken state probably would have made it to the original police report, as distinct from her self-reporting that she'd had a few beforehand. It seems more likely that the initial shock and trauma of the incident, perfectly understandable in the circumstances, had caused her to be an unreliable witness.

The correct approach then is a 'bottom up' approach where the profile of the participants in a field is then represented in the privileged positions for public view.Once we have, for example, 20% of the cohort involved in film roles that attract a nomination identifying as being a person of colour, then we can expect to see them earning approximately 20% of the nominations.",117,Applaudanum

I would also add that if the 'commenter' would have felt a little 'antsy' if a man said that exact same comment to them in the same situation, then they know their comment has a sexual connotation.I'm reminded of that scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson are arguing about whether foot massages (it is understood they are talking about a non professional context) have a sexual connotation. Jackson wins the argument, arguing that they do, when he asks Travolta 'Have you ever had a foot massage from a man?'.",101,Applaudanum

In fact, the rise of the 'careerist' politician has brought further disdain and mistrust upon our supposed leaders.

That does raise the tricky (for some) issue of genetics where the argument is that parents don't feel the same about non-genetic propagation.

2940,What your 'memorial/statue' distinction misses is the 'process' of history. How ideas change and mutate over time is an important part of how our history operates. A statue is the ideal form in which to represent both the transient nature of the individual (the ideas and life within which are subject to change) whilst also retaining permanent form (relative permanence in the case of humankind). Statues (the revered kind) and memorials both aim to impart an unchanging lesson for all time. But this unchanging lesson doesn't exist.,87,Applaudanum
