1,"You cannot offer a shred of evidence to support your assertion of what happens in the homeland, especially when the majority of arrivals under Labor were economic refugees, hardly fleeing persecution.",31,TheJediMaster
2,"I'd be far more concerned about the behaviour of PM's past. One even once tried to tell us that wearing as blue tie was unacceptable, now there's some abnormal behaviour.",30,TheJediMaster
3,Labor wanted to lock in spending six years into the future mainly for the NDIS. It was silly in the sense that the Coalition gave bipartisan support to the NDIS. Labor then tried to lock in the stupid Gonski spending and health spending through to 1919.  ,46,TheJediMaster
4,The $80 billion claim is based on numbers outside the forward estimates. Numbers that are five and six years into the future. Large Gonski cost impacts and more health blow outs.  ,31,TheJediMaster
5,"Friarbird - my bill went up when the CT was introduced, but to be honest i wasn't plotting it on a spreadsheet. Whether yours and the neighbours went up, or indeed went down last year is less relevant than the national trends.  ",42,TheJediMaster
6,GuardingOz - interesting name - and i fully support your coffee consumption. Again individual circumstances are one thing but overall trends are more important. Prices clearly did come down after the July 2014 repeal of the CT.,37,TheJediMaster
7,I'm saying that the Australian Bureau of Stats found that energy prices fell 5% after the carbon tax was ditched. You won't get any more compelling evidence of the price impact of the silly thing.  ,35,TheJediMaster
8,"On your bill, perhaps you should compare usage to the cost. You might perhaps find that your carbon footprint expanded, if your bill didn't fall recently. Conversely, bills went up 15% in the six months following the introduction according to some analysis.",42,TheJediMaster
9,"Yes some of the posters were a bit silly, but thanks for reminding us what a peaceful protest looks like. No assaults, no damage to property, no storming of the parliament house doors, no police required. Coincidentally, no unions or socialists around.  ",42,TheJediMaster
10,"BUT - next year Bill's going to start telling us all about his proposed new carbon tax. The one that will send electricity prices through the roof once more. Once voters sit up and listen, that will be the last we ever hear of Bill ! Adios.",47,TheJediMaster
11,"They all seem to describe the climate change ideologues rather well. Especially the ones arguing that climate change should be front and centre at an economic event, or an inter-generational report for that matter.",34,TheJediMaster
12,"Well we've been hearing ever since December 2009 the Abbott was unelectable, would never be Prime Minister, would ensure Gillard was returned, would ensure Rudd was returned, would be dumped by his own people etc etc .... ",37,TheJediMaster
13,"Hate to point it out but right now at present Abbott is in the Lodge, metaphorically, and the Coalition are in government. The next poll - well it could be 51-49 to the government. Abbott's been improving ever since the spill, and Bill's sinking before our very eyes.",48,TheJediMaster
14,"Well you'd suspect a routine socialist protest would normally involve breaking something, assaulting someone, chanting a few one syllable slogans, wearing something offensive, burning something, and finishing it all off with a rendition of Kumbaya before calling mum and asking for a lift home.  ",44,TheJediMaster
15,"With climate change events organised for Bonn and Paris this year, can we expect the routine socialist protests to be a little more organised than the amateurs in Brisbane ?",30,TheJediMaster
16,Not quite sure what Murdoch has to do with it. Or is that the only way you're able to cope with other view points - blame them on Murdoch ?,30,TheJediMaster
17,Maybe our socialists simply aren't as resourceful and skilful as foreign socialists. Those Greek ones seem amongst the best around - even looks like they've almost achieved the economic end of their nation. What a victory that would be. Wait on ....,42,TheJediMaster
18,This reminds me a bit of the time a bunch of hapless young socialist students infiltrated a Q&amp;A episode and unfurled their protest banner - upside down ! It's pretty hard to recover from there.,35,TheJediMaster
19,"Seems more evidence based. The G20 predominantly has an economic focus. Climate change might be the only issue that matters to some people, the rest of us live in a rather more pragmatic world where many issues can be discussed concurrently.  ",41,TheJediMaster
20,A more likely reason was that it was a silly idea in the first place - they couldn't get anyone but the most committed of occupying lefties to turn up. Losers.,31,TheJediMaster
21,"Yes it has potential, which is good, but it's a storage device. Something will have to be the power source - solar or wind in some cases, but coal in many others.",32,TheJediMaster
22,"Given that something like 25% of CO2 ever emitted has been done in the past 20 years, yet the changes in surface temperature over that time is next to zero, surely climate sensitivity is very much a young theory that needs much more work. ",44,TheJediMaster
23,"So why would we go spending tens of billions to address global warming when we have no idea what the real impact of CO2 emissions will be ? Take some cautious measures to minimise risk certainly, but dramatic action is far from justified.",43,TheJediMaster
24,"I'd prefer to help people genuinely trying to juggle work and family, and helping grow the pie in the process, than others who expect the government to support them from cradle to grave.",33,TheJediMaster
25,"So how is it that people become wealthy ? Is it purely luck, or do you think that working hard, working smart and taking a risk might have anything to do with it ?",34,TheJediMaster
26,20% higher than AWE is hardly rich. Although they pay a large amount in income tax to cover all those Australians who think the government should be their primary source of income.,32,TheJediMaster
27,As for Sydney-centric conspiracy theories well there doesn't seem much basis for that. Abbott's living in the AFP College - a rather humble abode for a Prime Minister - while the Lodge is being redone.,35,TheJediMaster
28,"Sure - each IPCC assessment report shows a reduced expected temperature increase. It started around 3 degrees and is now down below 1.5 degrees. They specifically stated there'd be a 1 degree rise by 2025, where the reality seems to be rather different.  ",43,TheJediMaster
29,"So it's very fair to say that the original scenarios overstated the issues. But that's never stopped the CC zealots from trying to sell the rest of us their silly doomsday prophecies. 'The greatest moral challenge of our time"" hey.",40,TheJediMaster
30,"Frankly i broadly agree with Lomborg - climate change is an issue but its impact is being overstated significantly by those with the most to gain. And the science supports that - record high ice sheet levels, 18 year flat lining temperatures, plunging sensitivity predictions.  ",45,TheJediMaster
31,"Had a quick look at your link. Couldn't see anywhere it suggested CO2 was bad. Significant warming linked to CO2 (as a greenhouse gas) may be bad, but is CO2 itself bad ?  ",33,TheJediMaster
32,"We're a bit past that point aren't we ? Even the supposedly climate denying Abbott government is formulating policy for post 2020, they're trying to determine the strategy for Paris in December, there's a RET and Direct Action.  ",38,TheJediMaster
33,"Are you saying that academic qualifications are the only thing that counts towards having expertise in a field ? Because many academics have rather limited real world experience, but are great in theory.",33,TheJediMaster
34,"You're probably right. And climate science seems to ignore much evidence too like record ice sheets and flat lining temperatures, so we could probably get a politician to act as chief climate change scientist. Or we could get a railway engineer.",41,TheJediMaster
35,"A few people think that climate change should be the only issue confronting health, transport, education, tiddlywinks and the production of widgets blah blah, but most of us are more sensible.  ",31,TheJediMaster
36,"We've just given a bunch of money to some UN fund that Obama loves - they can handle to allocation of funds to third world countries. I hope our foreign aid goes on real projects like building schools, hospitals, housing etc.  ",41,TheJediMaster
37,Anyone linking the appointment of Lomborg to this UWA body and our climate change policies has failed to read past the headlines. Thinking outside the square only works for people who've realised there's a square. Clearly many haven't.,38,TheJediMaster
38,Don't you ever do your own research ? That research was in part based on current IEA stats. Why don't you go to the IEA website and tell us the share of solar and wind today to global energy supply.  ,40,TheJediMaster
39,"Do you know the number ? Give you a hint, it fits on one hand. Actually one finger. How are you planning to increase it 100 times in 25 years by 2040 ?",33,TheJediMaster
40,The Australian Consensus Centre is designed to take a methodology of cost-benefit analysis to look at a whole range of Australian and global development challenges over the next 15 number of years to try and to work out where as a society we will get the best value for every dollar we invest. ,53,TheJediMaster
41,Is it possible the reason that so many lefties are carrying on about the Lomborg appointment is because of the successful direct action / ERF auctions announced during the week ?,31,TheJediMaster
42,"They've done everything they can to stop thoughts and ideas being shared. Even in the interests of then tearing those ideas down with their own brand of ""progressive"" logic. Pardon the pun again.  ",33,TheJediMaster
43,"If the lecturers and students can't distinguish between the issue of climate change and foreign aid, then there's isn't much hope for either group. Perhaps they need a better education.  ",30,TheJediMaster
44,"UWA has become a laughing stock. Laugh at the lecturers, who don't like ideas they don't understand. Laugh at the students, for whom education seems to be about learning nothing. And laugh at the VC, who crumbled under the pressure of the CC zealots. ",44,TheJediMaster
45,"You have to remember Marg, that the rich subsidise the poor to the tune of tens of billions annually. I was asking GMCB how he claimed the needy are being shafted - when the beneficiaries of this policy are the needy ! ",42,TheJediMaster
46,"Level of disagreement you reckon - well then Lomborg deserves a citation or two. Perhaps you could provide examples where citations are sought for dissenting views, lol. Sounds like you can order them online anyway.  ",35,TheJediMaster
47,And that's the point - Lomborg is there to form views on foreign aid. Yet his views on climate change - perfectly normal views - got all these lazy lecturers all excited. ,32,TheJediMaster
48,"Good result for Australia. Certainty for the industry, a win for the environment and a victory for both sides of parliament working together. There is hope yet for better government.",30,TheJediMaster
49,"But if true, Griggs should not be in charge of a troop of cub scouts, let alone a Human Rights Commission. To be the judge of other people you should have pretty solid credentials yourself.",35,TheJediMaster
50,"Triggs seems to spend her life preaching at others about how to behave. If these claims about the child are true, it means Triggs should not be making value judgements about any other human being, let alone prescribing policy a whole nation.  ",42,TheJediMaster
51,"¡°Boats have to stop. But have we thought about what the consequences are of pushing people back to our neighbour Indonesia?¡¯¡¯ Triggs said. ¡°Is it any wonder that Indonesia will not engage with us on other issues that we care about, like the death penalty?¡± ",45,TheJediMaster
52,"I'm not sure which planet Triggs was corresponding from, but from today's media reports it appears she's back with us here on planet Earth. Wonder what her next ridiculous stunt will be, and when the resignation may come.",38,TheJediMaster
53,Not too good on evidence is the hapless Triggs. She reckons there's some sort of link between capital punishment in Indonesia and Australia's boat policy. How's that one work again Gillian ?  ,32,TheJediMaster
54,"With the climate change battle being lost due to missing evidence, looks like environmental campaigners are now targeting our Barrier Reef for special treatment in the battle to drive climate change fear into all of us.  ",36,TheJediMaster
55,"As for the NBN - well what a shining beacon of all that was wrong with RuddGillardRudd - no business case, back of the envelope planning, nationalisation of a market, a financial mess, secretive, years behind schedule and a market that the private sector was building anyway. Hair brained stupidity. And then of course, Conroy.  ",55,TheJediMaster
56,"Sadly incoming Coalition governments always seem to have the same starting point - fix the Labor mess, stop the bleeding. Took Costello nine years to pay off the Keating debt. This one is far, far worse.",36,TheJediMaster
57,"Oh yes thanks for the reminder, all that legislation hey. Not sure when more red tape became the benchmark of success, but Abbott has at least been able to get rid of the worst of it - carbon tax, mining tax.",41,TheJediMaster
58,"Rather easily - besides the ABC promise, the Senate has effectively meant he hasn't broken any other promises, although i'm sure we can argue the toss on a couple of issues.  ",31,TheJediMaster
59,"And whatever promises Abbott has broken, nothing can or will match the extent of the carbon tax lie. And Bill wants to bring back an ETS. He's Tone's best friend.",30,TheJediMaster
60,"As we saw in the UK last week, the polls aren't all that flash at predictions, and Labour governments are quite rightly on the nose around the world. Two term Tone is likely.",33,TheJediMaster
61,"Sounds just like last year when the ABC were convinced they were onto the ""burnt hands"" story. How odd that the asylum seekers told a very different story to that of the Navy Officers directly involved.  ",36,TheJediMaster
62,"We'll never know of course, but if we had, there'd be no $350 billion debt, no massive deficits, no budget crisis and there never would have been a carbon tax.",30,TheJediMaster
63,"Another question then - being able to negative gear allows for more owners and more properties being listed for rental. So how does that ""contribute far more to the housing problem"" ? Seems like a logic meltdown.",37,TheJediMaster
64,"The whole episode this week has been quite revealing. In the last three months the polls have turned around for Abbott and the government. The budget has gone down well, Bill's personal numbers have tanked and he's well and truly on the back foot. ",44,TheJediMaster
65,"Then along comes the Union Royal Commission, and a bit of mud starts to stick to Shorten. It was always going to happen you'd reckon. But whack - all of a sudden there's some serious questions for the Labor leader to answer himself.  ",43,TheJediMaster
66,"So how do Labor react ? Accuse the government of a smear campaign. Hilarious. Bill's been dishing it out for 18 months, then turns to jelly when he gets a bit of the spotlight  ",34,TheJediMaster
67,"Clearly unfit for the highest office, there's now going to be some serious questions within the ALP, about who should lead them to the 2016 election. The answer may well be ABB - ""anyone but Bill"".",36,TheJediMaster
68,"Agreed Tim - much as we'd love to see the Labor leader fall, the next question would be who next .... Chris, Tony, Tanya, Albo. They're all dreary prospects, but surely none of them would be as wooden and empty as Shorten.",42,TheJediMaster
69,Stolen $80m hey. Would you prefer the unions continuing on their merry way of driving up construction costs which contribute to housing affordability problems ? Or might it be an idea to clean them up. ,35,TheJediMaster
70,"It's a real shame Bill didn't sign up for an interview or two on The Killing Season. He could have provided some great inside commentary on who stabbed who, why, and who was cheering at the time.  ",37,TheJediMaster
71,"Come to think of it, he could have saved the taxpayers a heap of money too. If he'd truthfully told all on TV about the union and about the RGR years, we probably could have avoided TURC in the first place. Oh well.",43,TheJediMaster
72,"Perhaps you should check out this article - it's about a bloke who spends his life criticising others and demanding all sorts of things - who, when the shoe is now on the other foot, complains like a spoilt child.  ",40,TheJediMaster
73,"It's possible it's the beginning of the end for him, although i'd prefer him to stay a Labor leader through to the 2016 election. Bill's the best chance of an another Abbott victory !",34,TheJediMaster
74,"Bill's been carping at Tony's ankles like a little yappy terrier for months now. Yap yap yap. And the second he cops a bit back - entirely of his own doing - he screams ""smear"".  ",35,TheJediMaster
75,"Slight difference between a North Shore Sydney seat and a rural Victorian one, but again it's nice you've got some hope. Not sure if the bookies would back Dick Smith too much. ",32,TheJediMaster
76,You'd expect the Abbott haters to lap this idea of Dick Smith's up. A review of the Warringah electoral history might be a little more sobering - it's been with the Liberal Party since World War 2.  ,37,TheJediMaster
77,"They seem fine to have taxpayers artificially fund billions of taxpayers money on renewable energy, yet have a problem with investors who then rent houses to those who can't afford to buy. How confusing.",34,TheJediMaster
78,"Tell you what - why don't you go and read the transcript then tell us which of the three versions of the ALP meetings that Triggs put on the record was the accurate one. She did, she didn't she might have ?",42,TheJediMaster
79,Triggs problem is that she takes some of the worst offenders - people who have seriously breached the human rights of others - and tries to turn them into victims.  ,30,TheJediMaster
80,Okay Barry so you're fully supporting the Triggs argument here. You've ignored that the Indonesians also appeal to other countries who have Indons on death row. Perhaps we can agree that the Indonesian position on the DP is conflicted at best.  ,41,TheJediMaster
81,"Agree with your first paragraph Tom - it's complicated. On the priest - yes they should lose some rights, perhaps though not as many as the murderer. They do lose some rights when society throws them in jail.  ",38,TheJediMaster
82,"Sure we've all made mistakes. But most of us have never made the mistakes that Basikbasik has. By taking a life, he's forfeited his rights. There's rules we have to abide by to have a decent society like we have. Child murderers should not have the rights to join our society.  ",51,TheJediMaster
83,"May i ask you a serious question though. Imho a person who has taken another's life - as Basikbasik has done - has forfeited their right to be treated as any sort of equal. There cannot be any greater human right than the right to life. Anyone breaching that has committed, essentially, the worst crime it is possible commit (in the case of court determined murder).  ",66,TheJediMaster
84,"Many pollies make changes to Hansard. You might want to refine your search to November last year, when Triggs changed her story to a Senate Committee three times in one day, around whether she'd had discussions with Labor MP's on an issue.  ",42,TheJediMaster
85,"¡°Boats have to stop. But have we thought about what the consequences are of pushing people back to our neighbour Indonesia?¡¯¡¯ Triggs said. ¡°Is it any wonder that Indonesia will not engage with us on other issues that we care about, like the death penalty?¡± ",45,TheJediMaster
86,"Right now Skippy the Bush Kangaroo would do a better job managing Australia's human rights affairs. We've had these statements, the Basikbasik affair, the lies to the Senate around detention centres, the baseless comments on asylum seekers / self harm.  ",40,TheJediMaster
87,"Oh i don't know jimbo - the boats have cost Labor plenty of skin, part of an election, a whole heap of respect, and has probably been the greatest political policy failure in recent years. Yet they still want to talk about them.  ",43,TheJediMaster
88,Tony Jones would have to be the rudest person on political television and his show is overrun by left wing drearies much of the time. That transgender singer and loudmouthed obnoxious Yank last Monday were terrible.  ,36,TheJediMaster
89,Michael - it's pretty obvious that nobody is censoring the ABC. The free speech argument is nothing to do with it - this is about a moral compass. Spectacular fail by the ABC.,33,TheJediMaster
90,"C'mon Ian, low blow. Yes he's that but also seems to be a rare case of going from that depth to managing thousands of people. That's about as much defence of Plibersek as i've got.",35,TheJediMaster
91,"She seems so lost at sea in the shadow Foreign Affairs role. Hopeless Health Minister, even backed the clueless ""Women for Gillard"" thing. She''ll never achieve her goal of PM, best to give up now maybe ? ",37,TheJediMaster
92,"Who are the options though ? Abo and Plib are lefties, and after the shambolic Jules there won't be a leftie PM for a decade or two. Bowen ? Burke has had a horrible week too.  ",36,TheJediMaster
93,"Ha ha. Every PM (since Menzies) has been dragged kicking and screaming from the Lodge. Most have been cut down by their own team (Gorton, Hawke, Rudd, Gillard), some by the voters (Whitlam, Fraser, Keating, Howard). Johnny was hardly any different.",41,TheJediMaster
94,"* It started with fixing the Keating budget mess* GST reform, setting the budget and economy up for surpluses and fairness* 10 budget surpluses* The Future Fund* Renewable energy target* Safe borders* Gun control* Record growth and employment* Stable government* Steered Australia through the Asian Financial Crisis and tech wreck* Set us up to navigate the GFC* Strong infrastructure record* Global leadership on foreign affairs* Strong humanitarian refugee program ",69,TheJediMaster
95,"Regardless, agree that national security ranks well above CC as a threat. The climate's been changing for billions of years. The death cult threat is far more of a clear and present danger.",33,TheJediMaster
96,"Are these the same climate scientists who refuse to give us some analysis of how and why the models are wrong, yet demand we keep pumping trillions into climate schemes ?  ",31,TheJediMaster
97,"What's so special is that IPCC AR1 came out in 1990, with its doomsday predictions. It told us that by now we would see a rise of 0.7 degrees (C) on a straight line basis. ",35,TheJediMaster
98,"Connor seems quite rational unlike a few of his buddies in Steffen and Flannery. He at least brings some hope to the enviro-lobby, lest it continue to reduce in relevance.",30,TheJediMaster
99,"So John Connor wants a ""A civil and constructive discussion"". Excellent. Let's see how much he - and the other left-leaning alliance members - wants that discussion when a few contentious issues come up such as our post-2020 targets.  ",39,TheJediMaster
100,"Barrie clearly wasn't prepared this morning, don't expect Scott will be too impressed with him. It's almost like these ABC-types float around like they're in an episode of Alice in Wonderland.",31,TheJediMaster
101,No doubt the outrage will subside - eventually - but sad to say that the ABC haven't yet worked out what they've done wrong. Maybe some common sense training might help.,31,TheJediMaster
102,"Not sure how large that group is, but yes, Abbott certainly has his detractors. Dunno why you sprout the ""frequent liar"" stuff. There's been a couple but nowhere near as bad as Jules carbon tax porkie. ",36,TheJediMaster
103,Groupthink is a fascinating concept though. Seems to be the place where even extremist viewpoints - as long as they're counter to the government argument - deserve plenty of airtime.  ,30,TheJediMaster
104,"The problem with the ABC of course is that because the product is so biased, many Aussies don't bother consuming. Yet they still pay for it. Does that seem fair ?",31,TheJediMaster
105,"What will Bill emerge smelling like soap from - TURC, Fairfax editorals demanding a resignation, his self-confessed lies, the political isolation or his new great big newer carbon tax ?",30,TheJediMaster
106,"Where to start .... for starters they removed the worst government in living memory, brought sanity back to the climate change debate, restored our borders, brought back some credibility to the budget numbers and made onion eating popular.",38,TheJediMaster
107,"Not sure which game you're watching. In the one I'm watching when the election is called if Labor is less than five points in front, they're gone. Once people work out that Bill wants us to have a new carbon tax. ",41,TheJediMaster
108,"So basically First Dog has finally worked out that Abbott and the government will probably win the 2016 election, and it means more conservative government for 3, or 6, or maybe the next 9 years.  ",35,TheJediMaster
109,"The Opposition Leader¡¯s personal ratings are the worst in his 21 months at Labor¡¯s helm, just as he faces the trade union royal commission and amid rumblings over Labor¡¯s policy direction and the struggle to find him a new chief of staff.",42,TheJediMaster
110,Before we sleepwalk to Paris - who's aware that it's quite consistent and logical to accept man influenced climate change and at the same time reject any need for carbon pricing ?,32,TheJediMaster
111,"Hard to work out what your point is Al. It sounds like you're quite happy to claim the carbon tax reduced emissions, yet reject that it increased unemployment. There's plenty of evidence to support both propositions. ",36,TheJediMaster
112,If you're trying to argue the carbon was good - well it was for emissions but it was also bad for the economy. the fall in GDP growth numbers also support the negative economic impact.,35,TheJediMaster
113,"Loving reading the comments about the $550 - ""where is it Mr Abbott?"". If electricity prices didn't fall then there would be a zero link between the CT removal and more electricity use !",34,TheJediMaster
114,"Correct - and that premise applies equally to the relationship between the carbon tax and unemployment, as well as between the carbon tax and CO2 emission reductions being reported by Pitt &amp; Sherry ! ",34,TheJediMaster
115,"But in the same way the link between the carbon tax and unemployment is indirect, so is the link between the CO2 figures and the repeal of the tax. The only thing that changed in both cases was input costs - wage and energy.",44,TheJediMaster
116,"Not even sure why people are surprised here - the carbon tax was always going to cost jobs in export markets and because of the rise in business costs. Qantas sacked 2,500 people at the same time as announcing a $106 million carbon tax bill, and two car manufacturers went under as well.  ",53,TheJediMaster
117,The cause and effect premise might be a little rubbery as you point out - but no different to the Climate Councils conclusions on the Pitt &amp; Sherry numbers. Works both ways you see.,34,TheJediMaster
118,"Did you see that ""analysis"" Steffen published the other day ? He took numbers from a poll in which most Canberrans did not support the crazy light rail project, then excluded all Liberal voters then tried to claim that most Canberrans supported light rail. Hilarious ! ",46,TheJediMaster

122,"It doesn't. But throw on top of that the orchestrated campaign against the government, the refusal to provide any balance, the lack of any conservative presenters, the failure to explore issues like the hiatus and present scientific balance, and you've got a mob who fail their charter which prescribes impartiality and balance.  ",52,TheJediMaster
123,"Sounds like Labor are still shaking their heads as to why the Australian voters removed them two years ago. Shorten's spent two days this week making a complete fool of himself in a Royal Commission, and Fitzgibbons reckons it's the Prime Minister who's out of control and is trying to censor the hapless ABC. ",54,TheJediMaster
124,"It's completely within the role of the PM to tell the ABC they have a charter and they should adhere to it. Between whacky zaky, burnt hands, Rudd phone tapping and chaser skits, seems like Aunty is completely out of control.",41,TheJediMaster

130,And isn't that the whole point - weather patterns change. I happily accept that mankind needs to clean up the rubbish we put into the atmosphere. But we haven't seen measurable warming for almost two decades according to some scientists. Best to tone down the alarmism.,46,TheJediMaster
131,"Greece's debt has been unsustainable for years. And now we have seen a developed nation doing the unthinkable and defaulting on it's debt. Which also means it won't be trusted for years. It can't issue bonds, it can no longer raise funds.  ",42,TheJediMaster
132,"How the Greek people voted for such stupidity in terms of a government is beyond me. The ""No"" vote last week confirmed that the Europeans simply need to jettison them, lest they drag the rest.",35,TheJediMaster

274,The thing that strikes me about Paris next week is that there's no key objective. There's no headline goal (e.g. 30% ERT by 2030) that is being worked towards. Have a look at their website: ,35,TheJediMaster
275,"Sure it raises a bit of revenue in the short term. But it decreases growth in the economy, which reduces government revenues. (we didn't run surpluses during the carbon tax years you might have noted). ",35,TheJediMaster

277,"$600 billion over 15 years is the only starting point we have for the RET prediction alone. If people don't like that number, they should tell us why it's wrong.",30,TheJediMaster

279,"Lenore - you don't seem too fussed that the ALP are throwing out big numbers like a 45% ERT by 2030, without even providing any ball park costs. Surely that's the starting point in any comparison between the alternative policy proposals.  ",41,TheJediMaster

If they can reach a mutually acceptable working relationship, then Abbott could continue to make a positive contribution to the Australian parliament and people.",51,TheJediMaster

321,"It's a brave person who claims that Australia's emissions are rising. The NGGI report clearly shows a downward trend in CO2 emissions overall, and in most sectors over the past ten years.  ",32,TheJediMaster
322,"Not quite sure what you're on about, but don't you find it fascinating that the article fails to mention that the last quarter was 0.3% below the 3rd quarter, or that our trend is firmly down ? ",37,TheJediMaster
323,"In fact we're over 10% below 2005 levels, not bad. This report seemed to neglect that, speaking of cherry picking. Did you get a chance to read it btw ?",30,TheJediMaster
324,"Had a good read of the NGGI this arvo, and you'd have to question some of the measurements. When the headline numbers are ""Seasonally adjusted and weather normalised"", it's hard not to smell a rat. Notably the unadjusted emissions are below the reported outcomes. ",44,TheJediMaster

651,"No idea what your point is, but otherwise that's fantastic news ! Income equality is obviously very good, low Gini, and the GFC was just a little blip. Like i've been trying to tell you guys all along.",38,TheJediMaster
652,"Although speaking of deflections, Mano's trying to draw some long bow from the oil shocks in the 1970's, without any mention of the 1997 Asian financial crisis or the tech wreck a few years later. All very significant.",38,TheJediMaster
653,"The reality is that every Labor government in the last 70 years has left Australia fiscally worse off than when they found it, measured by the size of their deficits and the level of net debt. See tables 1 and 5.  ",41,TheJediMaster
654,"2012-13 was $19 billion. But the last Swan offering was the 2013-14 budget, a whopping $48 billion deficit. Mind you, not as bad as his $55 billion shocker in 2009-10. ",30,TheJediMaster
655,"Yes, i love that ABC one. Before the government had even delivered a budget the ABC were publishing that nonsense. And yet some people still try to use today it as rational analysis. Gawd.",34,TheJediMaster
656,"If they had doubled the deficit then perhaps i might have. Sadly for your argument they've done nothing of the sort. Not sure where you pull krazy comments like that from, got a source ?",35,TheJediMaster
657,"Disagree with Turnbull on Labor's plans to pay for their next planned spending barrage - simply borrow more, pass the bill onto the kids. Gough did it, Keating did it, then Rudd and Gillard. Every incoming Coalition government has always had a Labor debt problem to clean up, it really does get boring.  ",53,TheJediMaster
658,"It's one thing to dislike Abbott, it's quite another to blame him for the actions of others, in this case a PM&amp;C public servant. It renders any valid parts of your argument fairly worthless.",34,TheJediMaster
659,"The problem with your long bow argument of course is that nothing about the Arthur Circle property ever had anything to do with Tony Abbott, but keep digging if you want. Mind you the property does look spectacular, fitting for a PM.",42,TheJediMaster
660,"If the issue is cooking and politics, there's been far worse incidents than this one. How about Swannie's cooking the books in the forlorn attempt to reach the oft-claimed but never delivered surplus back in 2012 ?",37,TheJediMaster
661,"But if we're talking about renovations, a $15k oven hardly compares to the damage done to the Lodge. After Gillard was ejected from it, the poor place needed almost $10 million in repairs !",34,TheJediMaster
662,"Think of the money Abbott saved taxpayers by staying at the AFP facility in Barton, rather than more salubrious and expensive options, befitting a Prime Minister. More than pays for a bit of kitchen equipment.",35,TheJediMaster
663,"If you look at the unemployment rate over the last five years, it headed north under RGR and the carbon tax. Having inherited 4%, turning that into over 6% wasn't a great performance.  ",33,TheJediMaster
664,"It would be a pleasure, will do. But given 70% of steel making uses coal, isn't the Labor policy to save steel jobs in significant conflict with their RET ?",30,TheJediMaster
665,"Bushfires happen naturally, and there's not a shred of evidence to link them to climate change. But no doubt the Climate Council used some extremely long bow to claim otherwise.",30,TheJediMaster
666,"T'was nice of red undies Conroy to pop his head up today, to remind us what Labor government looks like. With any luck Wayne ""we've returned to surplus"" Swan might do the same tomorrow.  ",34,TheJediMaster
667,The battle lines are drawn. Do Australians want responsible economic management (unemployment and growth both on the improve) and a move to fiscal repair (depending on the budget of course) ? ,31,TheJediMaster
668,"But then we see episodes like the Labor RSRT defence, an issue that could have hurt tens of thousands of truckies, where workers take second place to unions. Voters won't be impressed.",32,TheJediMaster
669,"With union support down to about 15%, if the CFMEU and TWU are front and centre of the election campaign, the government will get brownie points from the electorate. Nobody likes a bully.",33,TheJediMaster
670,The biggest impact on safety is the level of driver awareness and responsibility. Happy drivers - i am guessing - are the safest drivers. And small operators are not happy about the RSRT decision.,34,TheJediMaster
671,"The trucking market lends itself to free enterprise. For small operators, every job is an individual contract, they've been able to get business, deliver the service and often it's done by negotiating a price on every job, or building up a few repeat customers. Good management often means they've got a job on the way back home too, if they're long trips.  ",62,TheJediMaster
672,"To small operators, it's not about a rate which is a labour charge - it's about a price which is a commercial service charge. So the smart operators in a level playing field market can do well.  ",37,TheJediMaster
673,"The RSRT decision changes the playing field, it tells the owners that they now have to factor in pricing by the hour, when they generally work from a different business model. They courted trouble and trouble arrived.  ",37,TheJediMaster
674,The other point about the article that has to be made is those silly Sheldon comments - he hasn't even worked out that the reason this has become an issue is because of the stupidity of his RSRT's pay rates decision ! ,42,TheJediMaster
675,"I'm going to predict that come vote time, there may even be discussion amongst a few non union sponsored Labor members about crossing the floor, such is the stupidity of the Labor position.  ",33,TheJediMaster
676,"Sure battery technology will improve over time. But the world will never have 100% renewables no matter how much you dream of it. We may well get rid of fossil fuels in 100 or 200 years, but it won't be exclusively to wind and solar.  ",45,TheJediMaster
677,"Well given all the forecasts for coal consumption are expanding over the next 20 years, and the share of renewables hasn't changed for the last 10, it's pretty hard to see how we'll get anywhere near 0% within 35 years. Nuclear maybe ?",43,TheJediMaster
678,"And once again, the Greens have removed themselves from having any input into Australia's climate change policies. Their supporters must get sick of them constantly kicking own goals and standing against environmental measures like the RET, fuel excise indexation and direct action.",42,TheJediMaster
679,You know when a political decision like this one is popular all round - both the Bill Shorten and the Sunday Telegraph seem to be scrambling to claim credit for it. Bill even told us that Abbott is listening to the community.,42,TheJediMaster
680,"It seems funny that some people reject the clear medical scientific evidence around vaccinations, and would put their child at risk by not vaccinating. Not to mention the risks it imposes for other children and child care and school. ",39,TheJediMaster
681,"HH - at the end of the day one of the great things about Australia is we're one big happy family, who occasionally have an internal spat. We east coasters do love Adelaide, but could you kindly tell Koutsantonis to zip it please ?",44,TheJediMaster
682,"Weren't you a little embarrassed last year when Putin came over for the G20 with a few warships, and we couldn't even get a Collins class sub anywhere nearby to monitor them ?",33,TheJediMaster
683,"South Australia has it's place in the world as Australia's fine wine capital. The Adelaide Hills, Coonawarra, McLaren Vale and Barossa are great places to visit. Penfolds HQ in the Hills a must. ",33,TheJediMaster
684,"But outside of wine, SA is a bit of an economic backwater. 20 years of Labor have left debt, deficits, unemployment, little manufacturing and they made a real hash of building submarines. If anyone's thinking of seceding, hopefully SA goes first. But as the GST issue indicates, they wouldn't get very far without the large handouts the rest of us provide them.",62,TheJediMaster
685,"RET exists because it's a bipartisan policy. You can question how effective some direct action measures will be, and some are untested. But you can't complain about their purpose, which is to address climate change.",35,TheJediMaster
686,"We're well on track to hit our 2020 targets, the RET is close to finalised, we're getting a position paper together for Paris and the Emissions Reduction Fund is ramping up. Sounds like progress to me.",36,TheJediMaster
