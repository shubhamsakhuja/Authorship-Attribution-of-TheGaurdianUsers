1,Wonder why this would not be covered under PNG law - last I looked Manus was part of another sovereign state. Presumably our friends down at Maurice Blackburn feel they have a better chance of getting money from the Australian government than the PNG government. Will be an interesting test case.,51,TimOfAltona
2,Interesting hypothesis - doubt there will be leadership change just yet - the election is a long way off - Abbott has some plenty of time on his side to turn the polling around and they will later in the year. ,42,TimOfAltona
3,Spot on - the only problem is that Abbott will not go to an early election - (would you with polling like this?) - plenty of time for the polls to turn around before the 2016 election and the second term of this government starts. IMHO.,46,TimOfAltona
4,To the contrary - the government have released a series of policies that involve belt tightening - which is why we see the left bleating about losing their halcyon days of rivers of borrowed money flowing through the economy artificially propping everyone up. ,44,TimOfAltona
5,The government was always going to take a hit from the socialist set when they went about the task of fixing up 6 years of Labor's fiscal ineptitude.  ,30,TimOfAltona
6,"If Shorten (providing he is still leader) thinks he can get away with spinning ALP rhetoric until about 5 o'clock on election eve 2016 before he releases any economic policies and hopes Labor will just fall over the line, he is mistaken. ",43,TimOfAltona
7,How would you address welfare reform? Keep borrowing money from overseas to keep throwing at it? Or would you perhaps explore ways of reforming whilst still protecting the genuinely weak members of the community? ,35,TimOfAltona
8,I suspect you may be a bit confused - this is not the government proposing changes - it is the head of an independent panel Patrick McClure advising of his findings. ,32,TimOfAltona
9,Now c'mon - who's kidding who here - she left her party with 7 seats in a 90 odd seat parliament - the best political leader our country has seen in a long time??????,34,TimOfAltona
10,"You could be a little confused or mis-informed - this is not a policy, it is an initial report on findings which are now open to the public for input then a final report with recommendations back to the government later this year.",43,TimOfAltona
11,"1. The government (Kevin Andrews) is not  recommending these measures - he is discussing some aspects of the independant report coming from Patrick McClure, Sally Sinclair and Wesley Aird (worth taking a look at who these people are) ",40,TimOfAltona
12,3. Public submissions relating to the report findings are open until August 08.Feedback from the public and organisations operating or impacted by the report findings are critical to forming a final report along with recommendations back to the government.  ,41,TimOfAltona
13,5. If people have valid or genuine concerns (other than you just don't like a Coalition government in power) then feel free to make your concerns known to the panel who are encouraging feedback to assist them with their final report back to government. ,45,TimOfAltona
14,Hopefully this takes some of the hysteria and misinformation out of the comments in this thread - there is a need to review the current system and the genuine faults that exist.,32,TimOfAltona
15,What sort of world do you live in? Let's get back to reality - a % of young people spend their welfare money on alcohol &amp; illegal drugs. In your world you think the government should continue to encourage alcohol and drug dependencies through welfare payments? ,47,TimOfAltona
16,My advice to you is firstly read the full report (link in the article) - you will find references to your situation - if you still have concerns or want to make a statement direct to the DSS you have until August 08 to make a submission. ,48,TimOfAltona
17,Feedback by way of public submissions will assist a final report and recommendations. You do have a voice on this particular issue - the authors of the discussion paper want to hear from people in your situation to assist them with a final report/recommendation. ,45,TimOfAltona
18,"If you take the time to read both the article and the report you will seethis sequence is underway - reacting to a head line without understanding the detail leads too many people, yourself included, into making a ""thought bubble"" comment devoid of fact.",44,TimOfAltona
19,The government should be taking a look at this - the report has identified areas where inefficiencies and disincentives to people working exist. Overall good to see the government exploring any improvements to the current system - what comes out of this remains to be seen. ,47,TimOfAltona
20,Let's hear what the ALP say about this - oh that's right - they support off shore processing as well and will endorse the government transferring these people to Manus or Nauru *Labor cheer squad go silent*,37,TimOfAltona
21,If they are that far from Christmas Island - assuming there is a boat in the first place - then Indonesia is the closest to steer their 'stricken' boat to safety - or are they waiting for the RAN taxi pickup service? ,43,TimOfAltona
22,If Rintoul is encouraging them to stay at sea to try and make it to Christmas Island then if something goes wrong he will have some serious explaining to do.,30,TimOfAltona
23,Bishop's stature in the international community has been growing and Australia's support for the new regime in Burma will help transition the country into a true democracy in time. Her meeting with the Rohingya community is also diplomatically significant and helps them get a voice internationally. ,47,TimOfAltona
24,"The problem with your argument is that if Australia treats children differently to adults, or more leniently then hey presto! hundreds of people smuggler boats laden with children will be departing Indonesian coast line headed for Australia. Then it's a numbers game as to how many make it and how many possibly perish at sea. ",56,TimOfAltona
25,"Exactly the same thing is happening in the US right now with tens of thousands of children entering the US from Central America, why? because the US, under Bush, provided for extra protection for children entering the US illegally...it has now got so out of hand that the Obama administration are about to repeal the legislation which provides automatic asylum for children and will start deporting them back to their country of origin, mainly Honduras and Nicaragua. ",78,TimOfAltona
26,"Perhaps Fairfax don't want their publications advertising rallies for far left organisations such as Socialist Alternative, Communist Party Australia, Get Up and the like who are behind these events you are trying to drum up support for. ",38,TimOfAltona
27,I'll sleep better tonight knowing that we have so many experts on Sri Lanka commenting in the Guardian thread - they all appear to have a far superior knowledge of the situation on the ground as it relates to Tamils than DFAT does. ,44,TimOfAltona
28,"By the way - these people on the boat, if they are Tamils, came from Southern India - Tamil Nadu - of which Chennai is the capital, the language is Tamil, population 72 million and has been home to the Tamil people since 1500 BC. ",46,TimOfAltona
29,Good to see Albrechtsen join the ABC selection panel. She has a wealth of journalism experience. Transparency is the key here and there is no reason to believe any board appointment decisions won't be made with the best interests of the ABC at the forefront. ,46,TimOfAltona
30,Tears them apart that this government has actually gone out and implemented a policy that has saved possibly thousands of lives from drowning at sea - you could be mistaken for thinking the left wanted the drownings that occurred under the last Labor/Greens government to continue just so they can point the finger of blame at the current government. ,60,TimOfAltona
31,Trying to portray these events as some kind of harmless fun filled family picnic day when they are in fact led by radical left wing organisations is deceiving people. ,30,TimOfAltona
32,"I think this is what Brandis is saying - it's the left wing Wikileaks campaigner cum lawyer, Greg Barnes who is saying we may not be able to detain people returning from fighting with outlawed terrorist groups in Iraq/Syria. ",40,TimOfAltona
33,"Fair dinkum - as soon as we have a major terrorist attack in Australia which kills and maims innocent people, all these left-wing do-gooders will all suddenly go silent and hope we don't remember that they were the ones who constantly frustrated the government's efforts to protect our borders.",49,TimOfAltona
34,Bottom line - the government is delivering on a pre-election promise and is shutting down the evil &amp; deadly people smuggling trade kick started by Kevin Rudd and Labor in 2007. ,32,TimOfAltona
35,Boats don't depart = people don't drown. Fairly simple equation lost on so many who advocate welcoming the ten of thousands who would otherwise attempt the journey by sea and paying millions to people smugglers along the way. ,39,TimOfAltona
36,"Clive Palmer survives from one stunt to the next - beneath all the bluff and bluster he will always support LNP over Labor , although he's convinced/conned a fair few of the Labor cheer squad that he's on their side and many have fallen for it hook line and sinker. ",51,TimOfAltona
37,"I have a brillaint solution - let's shut down the people smugglers, stop the boats departing Indonesia in the first place, empty out and close down the off shore processing centres (like before), process all those in onshore processing centres then shut them down too (like before) and then everyone wins! ",52,TimOfAltona
38,"No more overcrowded processing centres on or off shore, no more men women and children hopelessly drowning at sea, reduce Australia's debt by billions of dollars, have an orderly and controlled asylum migration program that welcomes and provides the support for genuine refugees through the UNHCR program and no more First Dog cartoons attacking the government with click bait cartoons on this issue! ",64,TimOfAltona
39,"Actually we are both right - true, it was initiated under the Howard government in 2002 and Australia committed to the first order of 14 aircraft under the Rudd Labor government of 2009.",33,TimOfAltona
40,Yes you are spot on. Australia did not have the ship building infrastructure to embark on such a massive project - the cost to establish the infrastructure would have blown out the cost of the project by billions for the same result in the end.,45,TimOfAltona
41,It was the Labor government who did the evaluation and placed the order for these - the incoming government simply fulfilled the order - it was all in the timing. ,31,TimOfAltona
42,"PS - the aircraft have had some teething issues, but are far superior to any other military aircraft in our region and will serve the nation well - good on Labor and the Coalition for the foresight to get this going.",41,TimOfAltona
43,I'm with you - the boats have all but stopped - let's clear out the off shore processing centres by either voluntary or forced repatriation to country of origin for the economic asylum seekers or relocating to a third country for resettlement for the genuine ones and do it as fast as possible so we return to the status quo of the Howard years (before Labor came along a mucked it up),72,TimOfAltona
44,"That's fine, but we need to ensure we have the infrastructure and support services to handle large numbers each year - no point in bringing these people in if they end up being consigned to some kind of migrant ghetto with everyone living off welfare, unemployed and no prospects to build a better life. ",55,TimOfAltona
45,"You only have to look at some suburbs in Paris, Athens, Frankfurt, Naples or London to see what happens when migration gets out of control - oh and for god's sake - don't encourage any increased intake to arrive by people smuggling boats.",43,TimOfAltona
46,"You don't understand - these boats leave Indonesia or Sri Lanka with plenty of people both at the departure point and arrival point (Australia) who know who is on board, when they left, when they should arrive and also have contact with the refugee advocates in Australia. If a boat simply disappears the alarm will be raised including through the media. ",62,TimOfAltona
47,"They are, but economic migrants should enter the country through the correct migration channels like thousands of others do - not pay people smugglers to illegally enter Australia by boats from Indonesia.",32,TimOfAltona
48,Suggest any Brits tuning in also read comments in some other Australian newspapers to learn that this small but vocal (in the Guardian at least) left wing mob are in the minority.,32,TimOfAltona
49,If you want to start submitting complete and utter nonsense better be prepared to back it up - let's have this list of technologies developed tens of thousands of years before European settlement. ,34,TimOfAltona
50,"Funny how many people would rather not be here at all and would rather see Australia in 2014 back to where it was pre-colonisation in the 1700's, inhabited only by hunting and gathering indigenous people. ",36,TimOfAltona
51,"Abbott was referring to the contribution Britain made to establishing infrastructure, trade and investment in Australia when they arrived in the 1700's. He was not having a go at the indigenous people.",32,TimOfAltona
52,It would be being a tad disingenuous to suggest that Australia had existing infrastructure and global trade before the Brits arrived in the 1700's - the only point Abbott is making.,31,TimOfAltona
53,If you don't like what the government has achieved by late 2016 you can go and cast your vote and if the government has not been good enough or lived up to expectations and the consensus by the majority of Australians is that Labor/Greens parties have their act together the government will change. ,54,TimOfAltona
54,"Can't see any problem with the point he is making - In the 17th &amp; 18th century Britain colonised and then built infrastructure and trade in many under developed countries which had an indigenous population, Australia and NZ included, as did the French, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish. ",48,TimOfAltona
55,Kind of balances the books in a funny sort of way because we in Australia had to endure John McTernan from UK Labour as the chief strategist trying to keep Labor's Australian PM Julia Gillard in power. He resorted to plenty of subterfuge to try and prop Gillard up.,49,TimOfAltona
56,"Ian, I respect your point of view but the fact remains you cannot have uncontrolled migration across borders, particularly maritime borders without suffering the same horrific consequences you see in Europe today. The Abbott government policies enjoy a fair amount of support from countries in Europe who are suffering the massive social and financial cost of uncontrolled borders and migration. ",61,TimOfAltona
57,"As you well know, Rudd dismantled Howard's border protection policy and as you well know the result was a massive surge of people trying to reach Australia with onshore detention centres popping up all over the country and then were bursting at the seams and all the problems, riots etc, associated with that. The boats kept coming and coming, Indonesian and Pakistani people smugglers were turning into millionaires, people were regularly drowning at sea and Labor's popularity hit rock bottom. ",81,TimOfAltona
58,"Are we all happy with how they have gone about it? No. But it is working. The incentive to try to reach Australia by boat has been largely removed, the offshore &amp; onshore detention centres will be closed down (as they were under Howard) and Australia can enjoy an orderly and controlled refugee intake program which welcomes and assimilates thousands of genuine refugees each year.",65,TimOfAltona
59,1. Those who were pissed off that the coalition used this topic to win the last election and desperately want the policy to fail- just so they can say Abbott deceived Australia. It tears them apart that the scoreboard looks like this - ,44,TimOfAltona
60,2. Those who actually agree that the government has done a great job in shutting down people smugglers and preventing deaths at sea but have to maintain a confected attack on the government in order to 'stay in the circle'of their fellow Labor/Greens cheer squadders ,46,TimOfAltona
61,3. The bitter and twisted 'I'm on a mission' group - those who have since 9pm Sept 7 last year constantly attacked the PM and the government on anything and everything that arises as 'payback' for their large election loss. This grouping are easy to identify. ,47,TimOfAltona
62,"4. Those who genuinely believe that Australia should open up our borders and welcome and financially support anyone and everyone who can make it here by any means and claim asylum, even if it means hundreds of thousands attempt the journey each year. All offshore processing stopped and everyone can freely enter the community on arrival. This group turns a blind eye when the inevitable deaths at sea occur and pretend they did not happen. Greens? ",77,TimOfAltona
63,5. Those who have  empathy (not a politically motivated one) for the plight of the asylum seekers who try to come here by boat and want/expect the government to treat them with compassion and dignity within the framework of the existing policy. ,44,TimOfAltona
64,"Please enlighten us as to who would be replacing the government - the hapless, directionless, leaderless ALP; the increasingly irrelevant Greens or perhaps you are a PUP supporter? Can't really see any of those three up to the job now or in 2.5 years time IMHO.",46,TimOfAltona
65,We have a generous asylum migration program in place allowing thousands of displaced people to start a new life in Australia by going through the correct channels and being welcomed by the Australian community. ,35,TimOfAltona
66,There is no truth to the rumour that the Senate dress code had to be amended to cater for some of the newly elected cross bench senators -  ,30,TimOfAltona
67,"Ian, this one has been thrashed over and over again for months - it is not illegal to seek asylum but it is illegal to enter Australia on people smuggling boats without visas or identification, hence they are detained in processing centers if they can make it here without drowning along the way. ",54,TimOfAltona
68,"No, those coming by illegal boats and did not drown along the way would have been sent to Manus or Nauru where they would have been processed and settled in a third safe country.  ",36,TimOfAltona
69,"These people did not set off from Sri Lanka - they set off from Southern India where there is no Tamil persecution. True, many Sri Lankan Tamils live in camps, but they are safe to go about their business and earn a living for themselves and their families. The Tamil governer of Tamil Nadu is moving towards granting all Sri Lankan Tamil refugees Indian citizenship. ",66,TimOfAltona
70,We should note that  person on that boat was assessed as having a case to apply for refugee status and was given the opportunity to stay with Australian authorities &amp; have their case processed in Nauru or Manus - that person elected to return to Sri Lanka. ,49,TimOfAltona
71,Makes you wonder what marketing material is being used by people smugglers to entice people onto these boats - refugee advocate Ian Rintoul seems to be across what's going on here given people from the boats are in contact with him while they are at sea. ,47,TimOfAltona
72,Good to see the government holding firm on it's resolve and commitment to maintain border security to deter people smuggling operations. The people on board went through the accepted screening process and have been returned to their country of origin. ,41,TimOfAltona
73,"Remember, these people departed the relatively prosperous Tamil state of Tamil Nadu in Southern India home to tens of millions of Tamils - one could easily reach the assumption they were heading to Australia not to escape persecution but for economic reasons. This aspect would have formed part of the screening process and the decision to return them to their homeland. ",62,TimOfAltona
74,The lefties just hate the thought the Coalition have been successful where Labor failed dismally particularly as it was a key election issue - and Morrison successfully did the job Labor were incapable of. ,35,TimOfAltona
75,"Not a bad summation at all Katharine - the ball is fairly and squarely in the government's court now to turn around the polls and public perception they have moved too quickly on fiscal reform and left reasonably large swarths of the community behind. They have plenty of time to achieve this, but need to be seen to be heading in this direction. ",64,TimOfAltona
76,"As for Labor, well as you say Bill can't believe his luck - here they were expecting to be in opposition for at least another term or two and suddenly he gets a sniff which will embolden him to try and start acting all statesman like. Can he pull it off? Unlikely - way too much ALP civil war baggage around his neck in my opinion. Labor will need to resolve their leadership conundrum, the perception they are tied to the bootlaces of the unions and their love/hate relationship with the Greens before they are ready to take back government. ",101,TimOfAltona
77,"So you would prefer our elected government does nothing - simply allows people to come and go as they please - this is no fear campaign, international terrorism is a constant threat.",32,TimOfAltona
78,"Shorten will never be a PM - you know it, I know it and pretty much the rest of Australia knows it - except maybe a few hopefuls down at the CFMEU.",32,TimOfAltona
79,This is one left wing journo's opinion - many people disagree with him and applaud the government's success in shutting down the people smuggling trade and saving countless lives along the way.,32,TimOfAltona
80,"By all accounts the Tamil tigers gave as good as they got and by some reports more - not defending the Sri Lankan government, but it was hardly a one-way street as you make out - atrocities and human rights abuses were committed by both sides.",46,TimOfAltona
81,"Sarah Hanson-Young - wants everyone who claims to seek asylum automatic entry - hell, the Greens will even charter a flotilla of luxury passenger liners to go to Indonesia and empty out all the camps and bring everyone back to Australia - that's who.",44,TimOfAltona
82,"Good to see Alan Jones still dominating Sydney airwaves. Like him or loath him, he does not hold back on his views and Sydney siders embrace him for it. ",30,TimOfAltona
83,"Yep, disagreed when he dumped Steve Bracks for the NY Consul General post last Sept - should have left Bracksy in the role, he would have done a fine job. ",31,TimOfAltona
84,"Also, disagree when he and other ministers use the term 'mandate'. That word is sure to rile anyone opposed to the policy and is easily shot down in flames. No government has a mandate on anything unless there is a referendum held on a particular issue. ",47,TimOfAltona
85,Funny thing about all this is had Muir gone the other way on Arena they would be attacking him with grubby and offensive remarks not unlike the ones they bestow on the PM. ,34,TimOfAltona
86,"In the greatest traditions of Australian Labor, where Julia Gillard was not allowed to speak unless John McTernan pre-scripted her - who is scripting Muir? He sure as hell ain't coming up with this stuff all by himself. ",39,TimOfAltona
87,They use any platform to throw confected punches at the PM and government - they are all desperately trying to link Tony Abbott to Japan's atrocities during WWII - fail.,30,TimOfAltona
88,Mock professor Sloan at your leftist peril. I put it to you she knows a tad more about economic matters than your good self - your problem is she is not on 'your side' so you endeavor to take her down in the finest traditions of the Labor/Greens cheer squad.,50,TimOfAltona
89,"Your point is valid, however there is another very sad side to this equation which is overlooked - how about start posting the photographs of the hundreds of 'Ferminas' who have drowned at sea coming to Australia on people smuggler boats? ",42,TimOfAltona
90," Where are the cries of 'never again will we allow men, women and children to die at sea in their hundreds whilst travelling to Australia in people smuggler boats'? ",31,TimOfAltona
91,The Greens and the lefties using this topic to try and land blows on the government need to take a good look at themselves and at least acknowledge that the government's policies have saved possibly countless lives.,37,TimOfAltona
92,That has to be one of the worst pieces of journalism we've seen in recent times -I bet Andrew Street mulled over whether or not to include such a weak attempt at humour into the narrative or not - unfortunately for him he included it.,45,TimOfAltona
93,Can't understand why the cheer squad are fawning all over him - as though he is the great messiah who can land blows on the Abbott government on their behalf?  ,32,TimOfAltona
94,Clive can enjoy his 5 minutes of soaking up the adulation from an adoring Labor/Greens cheer squad but a word of warning Clive - as soon as you revert to your conservative roots and herd your cabal of senators into the blue corner the Labor/Greens supporters will start tearing you apart in these threads...it won't be a pretty sight.,59,TimOfAltona
95,"Longers, I deeply respect your views and compassion when it comes to Australian diggers and the atrocities they experienced at the hands of the Japanese in WWII - my father fought the Japanese advance whilst serving as an officer with the 10th Ghurka Rifles in the jungles of Burma and I assure you I can well relate to some of the horror stories coming out of that period - but mate, it was a long time ago and the world really has moved on - using Abe's visit to Australia as a platform to knock Abbott over Japan in WWII is drawing a very long bow - Abbott has said no more or no less than any other Australian PM, Labor or Liberal since the end of the war - Abe's grandfather was Japan's PM after the war and was warmly welcomed in Australia even back then. I think in 2014 it is well and truly time to move on.",160,TimOfAltona
96,"Bit rich coming from a person who will never be a Foreign Affairs minister to person who is a serving Foreign Affairs minister - with the greatest of respect to Ms Plibersek, she knows stuff all about international politics and relationships. ",42,TimOfAltona
97,"Let the Labor/Greens cheer squad enjoy the moment, but this charade will all end in tears for Clive and his PUP puppet senators - what's the betting the senators are around longer in politics than Clive?",36,TimOfAltona
98,Any genuine asylum seekers ie fleeing persecution or worse (hard to imagine given they came from Tamil Nadu) can go to Manus or Nauru for processing and resettlement in a third country or voluntarily return to their prosperous Tamil state in India. ,43,TimOfAltona
99,I read recently that the Tamil governer of Tamil Nadu is moving towards granting Indian citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils relocating to Southern India - this gives them the same rights for them and their families to work and ability to start businesses etc.,44,TimOfAltona
100,Your point about bias against the Japanese is valid - probably because the Scandinavian countries don't hunt and kill their whales in or near Australian waters - out of sight out of mind so to speak.,36,TimOfAltona
101,Time to finally accept that your side has lost this debate. Australians are backing Morrison and his achievements in shutting down the people smugglers and stopping drownings in their tracks. ,31,TimOfAltona
102,"Tough for you I know, but rest assured that the off shore detention centres will one day be empty and shut down - Christmas Island as well - as much as that disturbs you to see a major government win, it is a good thing for everyone involved. ",49,TimOfAltona
103,The Global Times do not represent the views of the Chinese government cheer squadders - it is a column by a journalist from this chinese media outlet expressing his opinion. The Global Times write critical stories about many governments around the world including in the past the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd debacles. ,50,TimOfAltona
104,Good to see the Coalition and PUP look like finally getting this carbon tax repealed whilst putting the Labor/Greens senate team back in their kennels where they deservedly belong. ,30,TimOfAltona
105,Valid observation - but my contention is that had Murdoch backed Gillard &amp;/or Rudd ot let's just say the ALP over the Coalition and irrespective of the election outcome these threads about Murdoch would be almost void of any criticism or the swarth of grubby remarks you see in here today. ,52,TimOfAltona
106,Murdoch was not responsible for the ALP losing last September - nor was Tony Abbott - Labor themselves were to blame as per the findings of the recent ALP internal review of last year's defeat. ,36,TimOfAltona
107,"I agree, we only want media owned/controlled by left wing organisations in this country - that way we can all enjoy a few rousing bars of while we munch on our morning weetbix whilst looking up at the mandatory portrait of the ALP leader on the kitchen wall. ",49,TimOfAltona
108,But seriously - it matters not who owns Australian media - they will still call out a bad government when it is a bad government - and at any examination the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd governments were hopelessly dysfunctional and the ALP paid the price.,42,TimOfAltona
109,He's spot on about the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd civil wars government - all Australia knows it was a dysfunctional rabble during those years (with a few exceptions) and was deservedly shown the door to opposition where they shall remain for at least another 2 terms. ,44,TimOfAltona
110,The sooner the Labor/Greens cheer squad acknowledge they were backing the wrong horse and move on to try and rebuild their shattered parties the better off they and their respective parties will be.,33,TimOfAltona
111,Of course the Labor/Greens cheer squad will attack anything to do with Murdoch - for he did not back their team last year when they lost in spectacular fashion. ,30,TimOfAltona
112,Bottom line here is that Campbell is leading an operation that has successfully shut down the insidious people smuggling trade perhaps saving hundreds or thousands of souls from drowning. Campbell enjoys the support of millions of Australians. ,38,TimOfAltona
113,Can't for the life of me understand why the Labor/Greens supporters denounce that - I don't for a moment think they would rather see people drowning at sea - but I would like just one of them to explain how else do you stop people drowning at sea in people smuggler boats apart from stopping the boats leaving in the first place? ,63,TimOfAltona
114,Here I was thinking 'Centreline' would be the first cheer squadder to admit that lives have been saved - but no - can't bring himself to do it - that would look too much like acknowledging the success of the government and that would  do in a Guardian thread.,50,TimOfAltona
115,He has done an excellent job in shutting down the people smugglers and saving countless lives - a pity he was not around when people were drowning in their hundreds after the Rudd Labor government started up the people smuggling trade again and carried on under the Gillard Labor/Greens government. ,51,TimOfAltona
116,"I know many left wing supporters don't like to see the success of Operation Sovereign Borders but I live for the day when  of the cheer squad admit that maybe, just maybe lives have been saved since boats stopped departing Indonesia and that is wholly a good thing. ",50,TimOfAltona
117,"33,000 feet in the air is hardly in a war zone and dozens of commercial planes follow the same flight path between Asia and Europe each day. Who would have guessed the Russians had handed over sophisticated surface to air missiles to allow the separatists to shoot down planes? ",50,TimOfAltona
118,Grubby personal comments aimed at a person's appearance means you instantly lose the argument. It means you have nothing left in your locker except personal abuse. Sums up many of the Labor/Greens cheer squad unfortunately.,35,TimOfAltona
119,The stupidity of all this is it is the left wing refugee advocates who are prolonging the wait at sea for these peole while they try to force through the High Court for Australia to take them. ,38,TimOfAltona
120,These people would be far better off returning to the freedom of Tamil Nadu than being forced to go into the off shore detention centres that the Greens seem intent on sending them to.,34,TimOfAltona
121,I see that Tamil Governer Rosahiah of this state is working on giving Sri Lankan Tamil refugees Indian citizenship to assist with their integration with the 70 odd million Tamil speaking citizens of this prosperous Indian state.,37,TimOfAltona
122,Why is it that the Labor opposition constantly undermines the government at every possible opportunity? They may have different ideas but this is unprofessional behaviour that would be unacceptable in any other workplace. ,34,TimOfAltona
123,LOL - the Australian Labor/Greens cheer squad desperately concerned the PM will come out of this with an enhanced global reputation and he and Bishop may actually be credited with bringing our dead home - sleepless nights ahead for the cheer squad as they grapple with this awkward situation they find themselves in. ,54,TimOfAltona
124,Abbott and Bishop are doing what we expect the Australian government do - it may irk the Labor/Greens cheer squad that they are making progress &amp; receiving recognition on the world stage - but bottom line is we want the dead home and we want them home now. ,49,TimOfAltona
125,For the people not from Australia reading this blog 'Yamba' is part of a group called the Labor/Greens cheer squad who infect the Guardian threads with grubby comments against the Australian government as payback for the devastating loss their political party experienced last year - nearly wiped out - so this is part of their campaign of vilification and retribution. ,61,TimOfAltona
126,The government can safely adopt the Hockey sponsored productivity report final recommendations once they come out later this year which will probably see a watering down of the paid parental scheme and funds channelled into early childhood reform. ,39,TimOfAltona
127,Sussan Ley is a class operator and correct when she says this is a once in a generation opportunity for reform. I would expect the government to adopt most if not all of the final recommendations later this year. ,40,TimOfAltona
128,A good friend friend of mine who lives in QLD tells me Newman has tried to do too much too quickly - changing the world overnight and he has managed to leave some people behind with some decisions. I suspect he will slow down the pace of change to better reflect community expectations. ,54,TimOfAltona
129,Time for the Labor/Greens cheer squad to take stock of their crass insensitivity to people dying and being killed just so they can try and land confected blows against the government. ,32,TimOfAltona
130,Read some of the posts from your mob in this thread attacking Abbott for doing the job he should as PM over this tragedy and then come back to us with an apology.,33,TimOfAltona
131,Good to see Abbott taking a world leadership position on pressuring Russia to allow access to the crash site. Abbott and Bishop are leading the charge on behalf of the relatives of the murdered Australians as well as all the other nationalities - exactly what we expect of our PM. ,51,TimOfAltona
132,"Can't see that happening myself, still over 2 years to go before the next election and plenty of time for the polls to turn around which they undoubtedly will as Abbott's policies gain traction and Labor's mismanagement of our economy is reversed by the new government. ",47,TimOfAltona
133,"What a load of crap. Your greatest fear is that Abbott gets the recognition he deserves for doing all he can to bring the dead Australians' home - you put your cheap political point scoring ahead of the deaths of Australian men, women and children and the grieving of their relatives.

144,The current group on board the customs vessel did not have a man with a gun at their head when they departed for Australia. They came from the relatively prosperous Tamil state in Southern India. They were not escaping fearing for their lives or escaping persecution - 70 million people live happily in Tamil Naidu... they were coming to Australia hoping to tap into our welfare system and perhaps get a job and perhaps give their families a better head start in life - there are tens of millions queued up behind them wanting to do the same thing.,99,TimOfAltona

146,"Yes - people smugglers do exist in the  world and yes, people hoping to bypass the UNHCR program and get to Australia by illegal boat do pay people smugglers for the service. ",34,TimOfAltona
147,"The people 'crewing' the boats are not the people smugglers - they are being paid by the people smugglers to do the job - the people smugglers have made millions of dollars and a % of this goes to the corrupt police, military and assorted Indonesian government officials who are also on the payroll to facilitate the safe departure of the boats from Indonesia. ",65,TimOfAltona
148,"Also, many of the people paying people smugglers are not genuine asylum seekers - they are economic migrants looking to tap into Australia's welfare system and with any luck get a job here. ",34,TimOfAltona
149,"You pretty much have to go back to the Labor government under Kevin Rudd that opened up our borders and got the people smuggling industry back on it's feet. Tens of thousands of people climbed into people smuggler boats and headed for Australia, many hundreds drowning along the way. ",50,TimOfAltona
150,"The new government came in to fix up Labor's mess and is making good progress - the ultimate aim is to close down all processing centres, on and off shore. This will be achieved by stopping the boats - so far so good on that front - much to the annoyance of the Labor cheer squad who wanted the boats to keep arriving just so they could come into the Guardian threads and proclaim yet another Abbott promise broken. Good to see that little piece of enjoyment has been denied. ",91,TimOfAltona
151,Thank you Longers - at last a Labor supporter who acknowledges that the government is doing the right thing in it's efforts to bring our dead home to their families. ,31,TimOfAltona
152,"Pretty much all the other's are attacking Abbott and Bishop with confected abuse over the handling and response to the tragedy. I guess their key issue is that they want it to be a  PM doing all this, not a Liberal and they can't bring themselves to acknowledge that Abbott and co have done a bloody good job so far in doing everything we can to help the families and bring their deceased loved ones home. ",78,TimOfAltona
153,"Funny thing is though, you have to stop the boats to achieve that - otherwise, as we saw under Labor, the detention centres keep on filling up, even having to open up new ones to cope with the thousands arriving by boat each month. ",45,TimOfAltona
154,"Now come clean with the Australian people Crowey - you know as well as all of us here that had Abbott left the country to attend a meeting in Palau, you and the rest of the cheer squad would be up in arms attacking him for running away and leaving the the families of the victims of MH17. ",59,TimOfAltona
155,"Best to give up on your attacks over Abbott and MH17 - he is doing what we expect the Australian PM, Labor or Liberal, to be doing and that is firstly - doing everything humanly possible to help the families &amp; to bring their loved ones home and secondly doing all the Australian government can to to assist in bringing the perpetrators to justice. ",65,TimOfAltona
156,Some events transcend domestic politics and this is one of them - follow the lead of your Labor party who have thrown their weight behind Abbott to help him get this job done.,33,TimOfAltona
157,"I think the Labor supporters give Murdoch way too much credit - whilst he was a useful distraction for them away from their internal disunity and dysfunction - I suspect he holds little if any sway over Australian domestic politics. Ask former PM's Rudd and Gillard, they 'consulted' with Murdoch over dinners and lunches whenever they were in NY - I doubt they would support the conspiracy theorists active in these threads today (aka Labor cheer squad) that Murdoch influenced them one way or the other. ",87,TimOfAltona
158,"Who cares if Abbott discussed the PPL with Murdoch over dinner, he probably discussed a lot of things going on at the time - the PPL scheme was on Abbott's radar years before any dinner with Murdoch - it was out in the public domain back in 2010.",48,TimOfAltona
159,"They all beat a path to Murdoch's door when they to NY- Hawke, Howard, Rudd, Gillard, Abbott all have lunches and dinners with the News Corp chairman. Shorten will be working his way to meeting him as soon as he can swing it - if he holds onto the leadership that is.",52,TimOfAltona
160,The truth can be hurtful at times...we have all been there. Don't give up though - there  a place for Labor - it's just that this is not the time.,31,TimOfAltona
161,"Most are living in denial that Murdoch was calling a bad government for what it was, a bad government. At any examination the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years were not the best for Labor - dysfunction, back stabbing and leaks were a daily occurrence. ",42,TimOfAltona
162,Even the ALP's internal report on last year's election failure stated it was down to internal dysfunction fueled by intense and very public rivalry between the Gillard and Rudd camps. ,31,TimOfAltona
163,"The ALP's current leader, Shorten, was a key player/contributor to all the unfolding dramas and has, thanks to the unions, been rewarded with a temporary seat at the head of the table. He will not survive in that role if Labor is to have any chance of forming a government in the years ahead. ",55,TimOfAltona

170,But Ian herein lies the problem for Labor - Labor PMs and leaders are seen to be mere puppets for the strongest unions - Gillard is an excellent example. ,30,TimOfAltona
171,Unions are not as relevant to the Australian way of life as they were say 50 or even 30 years ago - in fact unions only represent a small % of the working population. ,35,TimOfAltona
172,This brings into question the whole relevancy of Labor as a political party and we end up with the infighting and back stabbing of the past 6 years - factions fighting for territory for a piece of a rapidly shrinking pie. ,42,TimOfAltona
173,"Shorten is trying his best to reignite the ""Light on the Hill' rhetoric - but this will fall largely on deaf ears - Australia has moved on from all that working class romanticism crap largely because so many more of us are much better off than we were 20 or 30 years ago. ",54,TimOfAltona
174,"Shame the cheer squad can't throw their support behind Abbott and Bishop's efforts to bring our dead Australians home to their families - in fact they are outright criticising them for doing what we expect them to be doing and achieving. From what I see and hear, the PM is being praised around the globe for his leadership achievements after the tragedy. ",63,TimOfAltona
175,Abbott has been surviving off minimal sleep since the MH17 disaster - he has been working during different time zones to discuss/coordinate the situation with various world leaders and our team on the ground - typically Europe between 2 and 4 in the morning and then going on to do a full days work. You choose to comment on his eyes as 'evil'. Try tired comrade.,66,TimOfAltona
176, is why Labor are out of office for the next 2-3 terms - the disconnect from reality blinds their judgement to the point that they live in a parallel universe from mainstream Australia.,34,TimOfAltona

181,HaHaHaHaHa Daisy - that is so coming from a long time member of the Labor/Greens cheer squad who between them spend hours on the Guardian threads each day writing hundreds of grubby and vilifying comments about Tony Abbott. ,39,TimOfAltona
182,"Exactly - I have been saying this for some time but keep on being shot down in flames by the Labor cheer squad....seriously, if Labor are to have any hope of forming government over the next 6-9 years they need to refocus on reform - Labor and their supporters banging on about the evil Tony Abbott &amp; hoping that will be enough to get them over the line is pure delusion and will ensure they stay in opposition for years to come.",82,TimOfAltona

192,The left are on the wrong side of public opinion on this one and lost the argument a long time ago...this government is to be congratulated for delivering on what they promised and what we voted for last September. Labor were just not up to the task...how many PM's did they go through and how many Immigration ministers did Labor churn through - was it 5 or 6? None of them up to the task - all failures. ,79,TimOfAltona

It is the right thing to do to bring them ashore temporarily until the High Court judgement is handed down and then they can either be returned to Tamil southern India or over to Manus or Nauru for processing. It is fairly likely these are economic migrants simply looking to improve their lives in Australia so either they return to India or their original homeland. Those determined to be  refugees can be resettled in a third country such as PNG, Nauru or Cambodia. ",101,TimOfAltona
198,You seem to be confused .the police are there for security dutiescrash investigators and forensic teams will be doing the work on the wreckage and human remains. The police are there because it would be too problematic for ADF or any troops from any country to be on the ground in that situation. ,54,TimOfAltona
199,Julie Bishop and her Dutch counterpart are making good progress in Kiev to bring this about with Ukrainian authorities whilst Abbott is dealing with Putin on the Russian side to allow unrestricted access for the multi-national police contingent to provide security whilst the forensic and recovery teams do their vital work. ,52,TimOfAltona
200,"Correct, the same occurred in 9/11. The key to this is forensic examination of the various crash sites to occur as quickly as possible before too much evidence or remains are lost...hence the government pushing for a security team to assist with this process.",44,TimOfAltona

213,What a load of crap - Gillard was the most detested PM in a generation - had she gone on to lead Labor to the election they would have been lucky to come away with 30 seats in the lower house - such was the feeling of animosity towards her - not only from mainstream Australia but within her own party. The only reason her and Combet were bosom buddies was because they were both marionettes for the powerful unions who dictated ALP policy through the PM placed into office.. ,91,TimOfAltona
214,The 'Gillard' experiment crashed and burned for Labor and they will never ever repeat that mistakenot if they ever want to return to government in this country. Gillard was a disaster - nearly destroyed her own party.,37,TimOfAltona

224, the polls have transformed from being highly dubious and a totally unreliable tool of a giant media conspiracy against Labor into a highly credible and accurate source of how voters feel about the government. ,36,TimOfAltona
225,Don't worry about that comment - it's the Labor/greens cheer squad worried that the PM may look good for what he's done following the tragedy - they can't stand the thought that he may actually have made a major contribution to bringing our dead home and will receive praise for it - none the least from the relatives of those tragically killed.,62,TimOfAltona

312,Here's a useful tip though - I think you will find a fair few Labor/Greens cheer squad members supporting you as anyone Abbott criticizes is immediately befriended by the cheer squad as one of their own -it's just the way it goes.,42,TimOfAltona

360,Shhhhhh...don't mention that to the Labor/Greens cheer squad... they have duped themselves into thinking that a Labor/Greens government will just flop over the line in 2016 without doing or saying anything...albeit releasing a couple of policies at around 5pm the night before the polling day.,45,TimOfAltona
361,Nice try by the Labor/Greens cheer squad trying to link Palmer's comments to the Abbott government - falls on deaf ears though - Palmer is clearly 'out there' at the moment and is buddying up to Labor to try and block Budget elements in the senate. ,47,TimOfAltona

375,"I hear your point, but I doubt IS fighters have much interest on who is the PM or which political party is in power in Australia while they go about their jihad - this same situation could have easily arisen when Labor were in government and Labor would be grappling with the same conundrum.  ",56,TimOfAltona
376,I think we all saw Gillian Triggs over-reach with some of her comments made to the Minister on Friday - prisons and armed guards. It was unfortunate because it was echoing a Sarah Hanson-Young type of rhetoric which tends to fall on deaf ears with the majority of the electorate. ,51,TimOfAltona
377,Triggs would have been better to stick with the facts without resorting to inaccurate or misleading statements (perhaps she genuinely believed the processing centre staff carried guns?) but as Chair she should have better informed herself. ,37,TimOfAltona

381,"I think the reality is also that Labor have been very uninspiring and highly unconvincing in their arguments against the budget - apart from promising to increase spending, axe the proposed savings and (by definition) create billions of dollars in additional debt if they were in government, we have seen little or nothing from them on how they would fix up their mess of the past 6 years.

384,Why do the Labor/Greens cheer squad always resort to childish name calling - to me it looks like they have lost the argument &amp; have nothing left but the antics you see more commonly in primary school children. This gives me great comfort that the Labor/Greens party will occupy the opposition benches for many years to come. IMHO.,58,TimOfAltona
385,The point I make is that there is a world of difference between armed and non-armed guards - particularly in these facilities. Triggs was wrong to assert that there are armed guards in the detention centres - there are not and never have been. Facts are facts.,47,TimOfAltona

398,"Just so happens that right now 99.9999% of the IS jihadists rampaging through Iraq and Syria are Sunni Muslims or those who have converted to Sunni Islam and Sharia law, so it makes pretty good sense to have dialogue with the various Muslim groups represented in Australia. ",48,TimOfAltona

406,"While the majority of Australians are happy to see this country lend a hand to stop both the ISIS advance and the protection of minority communities, it seems the Labor/Greens cheer squad's primary area of concern ahead of the slaughter in Iraq is that the Abbott government may actually look good for helping prevent genocide and how many votes that may translate to in late 2016.",66,TimOfAltona
407,Funny how Abbott and Shorten are essentially saying the same things in relation to this humanitarian disaster but the Labor/Greens cheer squad focus their attack on Abbott but completely ignore Shorten's almost identical comments - it's as if Shorten does not even exist any more or is completely irrelevant in this discourse - I pick the latter.,57,TimOfAltona

414,Part of Joyce's problem is that he came from a low cost airline background firstly in Europe and then Jetstar. I just don't think he transitioned well into the full service environment that was QF. He may have been better to remain heading up Jetstar and reporting into the QF CEO.,51,TimOfAltona

416,Qantas used to be on par with the big global airlines but have definitely dropped a few notches over the past 10 years - I think it's a mix of bad management and complacency. I would rate the attitude of QF cabin crew on par with that of the larger US airlines - which means it just ain't that good. ,61,TimOfAltona
417,Tony Sheldon is spot on when he says that Qantas need to change their CEO if they want to recover from this. Joyce has been a failure through and through and the QF Board (who recruited Joyce over Borghetti) are also to blame for this result.,46,TimOfAltona

This is the only state presiding over a budget surplus (despite Labor's disasterous white elephant desal plant) and this fact alone should be enough to get the Libs across the line. Labor is just too risky.,51,TimOfAltona

445,Gillard may have been a very personable individual - but she was the most loathed PM Labor have ever experimented with - she was on track to nearly wipe out her own party at the election had she not been taken down by Shorten and thrown out of office. ,50,TimOfAltona
446,Unlikely - they will continue to thrash around in the political wilderness searching for purpose and leadership for the next few years....of course they will at some point regain government in this country but that time is a long way off...perhaps another 3 terms or more. How many leaders do you think they will churn through until they come up with a winner? ,64,TimOfAltona

",95,TimOfAltona
455,Labor are still years away from rebuilding their shattered party and still quite a way to go to sort out their leadership problems and the ongoing civil war between the left and right of the party. They also need to work out a way they can rebuild and move forward without having to rely on their Greens partners to get them over the line. There will need to be at least another two changes of leadership in Labor and Milne will have to also be gone from the Greens before Labor look anything like an alternative government.

The indicators are there now. ",67,TimOfAltona

482,"Successive governments, Labor, Liberal, state and federal have collectively poured  of dollars of 'funding' into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities - building houses, schools, community centres, recreation facilities, drug and alcohol abuse programs, anti-sexual assault programs, homelessness support, adult education/training and employment programs - all designed to support and assist these Australian communities in rural and urban areas.

483,It's an old cliche I know but the old adage that the people smugglers never had a better friend than in the Australian Greens who will provide them with a viable business model if they ever got into government or took control again of Labor policies.,46,TimOfAltona

487,You must have been living under a rock for the past few weeks -  the government has done has been aimed at preventing home grown terrorism - that's why the Labor/Greens supporters are up in arms. ,38,TimOfAltona
488,"You see, people won't trust another Labor/Greens government so soon - particularly with all the Labor leadership dysfunction still swirling around and the ALP grappling with it's defacto marriage with the Greens ( do they split or do they still cuddle up with each other in bed?)  the overall future direction of the ALP still up in the air after the crash and burn of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd experiments. ",70,TimOfAltona
489,"What a sad and sorry bunch the Labor/Greens cheer squad are these days - first they criticise him for not going up there, then they criticise for being up there (wasting taxpayers money &amp; running the country from a tent) and now they criticise him for perhaps returning early due to events in the Middle East. ",57,TimOfAltona
490,So in your view the PM should go up there but have no contact with the people he is visiting just in case a photographer captures the moment and the PM is portrayed favourably in the image? ,38,TimOfAltona
491,Bottom line is you have no bloody idea what discussions the PM had in private with Yolngu elders yet you manufacture your version to denigrate Abbott - unless of course you come back to us and tell us you were sitting down with the PM and the Yolngu elders and heard for yourself what was discussed then your posts may have a little more credibility.,65,TimOfAltona
492,Julie Bishop has actually grown in stature in the job - she has created a very positive image for herself and Australia over her handling of the MH17 disaster and the Iraq crisis. ,34,TimOfAltona

513,"I also add that the accompanying threat by Sinaloa is that they survive not only through killings of competitors but also widespread corruption of police, military and government officials. ",30,TimOfAltona
514,You raise a very good point Daisy - the Sinaloa cartel do represent a real threat to Australia given the atrocities they commit in Mexico funded by billionaire drug bosses. ,31,TimOfAltona
515,The difference between the two groups is that ISIS is all about religion/ideology and seek to destroy those of different beliefs whereas Sinaloa is all about the money and tend to target and kill only those involved in the drug trade - not butchering thousands of innocent men women and children. ,52,TimOfAltona
516,"That was not the question I was responding to... he wanted to know how a dual Australian/Israeli citizen performing military/conscription service with the IDF and being required to enter Gaza, which may be a 'no travel' area given Hamas is a prescribed terrorist organisation would be treated by the proposed new legislation.",52,TimOfAltona
517,IDF are not a prescribed terrorist organisation and are in Gaza as a direct result of a lawful direction from the Israeli government to combat terrorism against the state of Israel.,31,TimOfAltona

539,"By the way - any thoughts on Peter Slippers sentence today? You know, the guy you 'cleverly' drafted into the Speakers position to try and shore up the failing Gillard government's numbers? ",33,TimOfAltona
540,The media called it for what it was - an ineffectual and incompetent PM who was a Labor Party experimental blow-in who crashed and burned and nearly brought her whole god damn party down with her. ,37,TimOfAltona
541,It is such a shame that Australia's first female PM could not have been a person who was firstly voted in by the people and who also had the respect and support of Australians. What we had with Gillard was contempt and loathing.,43,TimOfAltona
542,"This Tony Abbott fellow must be some kind of demi-god - totally responsible for all the evil on this planet - every natural disaster, homicide, genocide, earthquake, famine, wars, pestilence, terrorist attacks, shark attacks, motor vehicle accidents, crime waves, riots, massacres etc etc etc are all down to the Australian PM.",51,TimOfAltona
543,As PM she was largely being scripted by John McTernan - pretty much every media appearance/statement by Gillard had her parroting scripts pre-prepared for her by McTernan - hence the robotic nature of her media appearances. ,37,TimOfAltona
544,The whole misogyny beat up was the brain child of McTernan scratching around for something that would resonate with the female vote and try and lift Gillard's dismal approval rating - he had previously used the same tactic against British PM David Cameron when he was advising the UK Labor party.,51,TimOfAltona
545,"Daisy, he said he would never do deals to ala Julia Gillard. Of course he has to negotiate to get bills passed through senate - it's the normal process when the government of the day does not hold a majority. Abbott will deal with PUP, Greens, Independents and even Labor to get bills passed. ",55,TimOfAltona
546,Naturally the Labor cheer squad then ignore the polls or call them a media conspiracy because they don't want to face up to Labor's inherent weaknesses - of which there are many.,32,TimOfAltona
547,"Labor supporters can argue amongst themselves all they like over whether it was Rudd or Gillard who brought the party to it's knees in the lower house last September , but the 3 key issues still exist that will keep them out of government for the next two terms at least, namely - ",54,TimOfAltona
548,"1. Leadership dysfunction and factional infighting. The ALP go to great lengths to keep a lid on these two corrosive ALP attributes, but they are always just below the surface bubbling away. Disunity is death. ",36,TimOfAltona
549,"2. The stigma of being viewed as nothing more than an extension of the powerful unions, some militant (Gillard was tainted by this). I get that Labor are the political arm of the union movement and all that but you only have to look at the makeup of the Labor senate and you pretty quickly see where all the old union hacks end up. Parachuting into the senate is a favourite pass time for ex-union officials looking for reward for their union stewardship.  ",85,TimOfAltona
550,3. The ALP's reliance on the Greens to both get them into government and then staying in government. You only have to look at what happened across the Tasman last Saturday to see what mainstream voters think of Labor/Greens governments - Australia is no different. Everyone can see that the Greens having helped the ALP then hold them hostage to Greens policies (again - Gillard and the Carbon Tax) and we really don't want to go down that path again. ,81,TimOfAltona
551,"She may have been a good person and all that, but she was totally inept in this role and very nearly lead the ALP to a defeat they may have never recovered from. ",34,TimOfAltona
552,"Rudd, for all his faults did save some of Labor's furniture last September. Had Gillard not been removed by Shorten et al, Labor would have been lucky to be holding 30 seats in this current Parliament such was the loathing Australian voters had for Gillard. ",46,TimOfAltona
553,This woman is a product of Clive Palmer placing newspaper ads in Tasmanian newspapers calling for Tasmanians to apply to join his party as a senate candidate...could be she was the only one who stuck her hand up. ,39,TimOfAltona
554,"What I don't get is how she went on Insiders knowing the discussion/questioning would be about muslims, hijabs and Islam and she had no idea how to describe or explain sharia law when asked by Barry Cassidy - it was a classic Pauline Hanson moment and made her sound totally inept.",51,TimOfAltona
555,He's part of that esteemed group of Guardian commentators who think this whole thing is a conspiracy between ISIS and the Australian government designed to keep the current Australian PM in office.,32,TimOfAltona
556,He's a regular left-wing activist in these threads - attacks anything the conservative Australian government do to stop the terrorism threat through fear that any success in this area will see the current government be re-elected in 2 years time.,40,TimOfAltona
557,"You can't be serious - how many failed Immigration ministers did Labor trawl through over the 6 years not one of them able to achieve what Morrison has in his first year - Boats stopped, detention centres being emptied out and best of all, possibly hundreds of lives saved. ",50,TimOfAltona
558,We all worked out why the Labor/Greens cheer squad don't like Morrison - because he showed Labor up to be the incompetent government they were when it came to border protection and proved to Australian voters that we got it right by voting the Coalition in to fix up Labor's mess and we will all over again in 2016.,59,TimOfAltona
559,Morrison is very good communicator - his performance in parliament is up there with the best. I can see him moving into more senior government portfolios over the next few years.,31,TimOfAltona
560,Abbott actually made a pretty good speech on his UN debut - he had the world's most powerful leaders tuned into his narrative on fighting ISIS - made Australia look very good. ,33,TimOfAltona
561,Watching Abbott presenting at the UN Security Council begs the question - can anyone see the leader of the alternative Australian government sitting at the Security Council table dealing with these critical issues?  ,35,TimOfAltona
562,My advice to the Labor supporters - you had better get a wiggle on and sort out your leadership problems - trying to change leaders too close to the next election guarantees you will remain in the political wilderness for another two terms at least.,45,TimOfAltona
563,Joe does have a lot of fun at Wayne Swan's expense - checking under 'S' in the index of Swanny's book for the word 'Surplus' - no where to be found. ,32,TimOfAltona
564,"Despite what many Labor/Greens supporters contend in these threads, I'm pretty certain that ISIS and the Liberal Party did conspire with each other and arrive at a genocide plan for Iraq and Syria in order to secure Tony Abbott's re-election in 2016. ",43,TimOfAltona
565,"To all the Labor Gillard supporters on here I say this - I'm with you,Gillard should not have been knifed by her own party &amp; replaced by Rudd. She should have stayed on and lead Labor to an even greater crushing defeat last September. ",45,TimOfAltona
566,I hear the book stores have already got it on 50% off a day or two after it's launch - wait another couple of days and it will be in the 90% off bargain bin out the front of Dymocks.,40,TimOfAltona
567,"Andrew, you missed the bit where the rather jovial &amp; harmless looking fellow with the balaclava is randomly raping, shooting, crucifying and beheading men, women and children from christian, Shiite, Kurdish and other assorted minority groups who's only crime is that they happen to be in the way of these terrorists establishing their 'caliphate'.  ",56,TimOfAltona
568,Clearly you disagree with the 'west' trying to stop this genocide - if you are representative of the Labor/Greens cheer squad on this issue then I put it to you that it will be many many years before Labor and Greens will be trusted with governing this country again. ,50,TimOfAltona
569,This is the action of a strong government fixing up a bloody big mess created by Labor ineptitude - starting with Rudd handing the people smugglers a beautifully crafted business model to work with - what we see today is the result of all that. ,46,TimOfAltona
570,Congratulations to Morrison - ultimately the camps at Nauru and Manus will be emptied and shut down and since the boats have stopped arriving they will remain shut......until the next Labor/Greens government get into power and then it starts all over again..,42,TimOfAltona
571,"Milne has dealt herself and her party out of contention for anything in 2016 and Labor are, well...just Labor....hanging onto anything that they think will keep them in touch with the current government...but know deep down they must surely lose Round 2 in 2016.",44,TimOfAltona
572,A poor bloke on his ipad walks through security at the airport and the Labor/Greens cheer squad are calling for the Australian PM to resign because it's all Abbott's fault..  ,32,TimOfAltona
573,A win for the refugees who have the opportunity to start afresh in a safe country which is signatory to the 1951 refugee convention along with financial assistance from Australia ,31,TimOfAltona
574,"A win for Australia because it means the off shore detention centres will in time be emptied &amp; closed (What will the Greens have to complain about then?), the boats have stopped so there are no more people arriving to fill them up (unlike under Labor) and our orderly UNHCR migration program can continue and those genuine refugees and their families can look forward to being welcomed into Australia with open arms and assimilate into our community. ",78,TimOfAltona
575,I suspect you will find a couple of seriously injured policemen in hospital who would disagree that this person's only offence was being a person of interest comrade - oh....and about 20 million Australians as well.,36,TimOfAltona
576,Wrong - Morrison will be our next Defence Minister - Turnbull will possibly replace Abbott when Abbott goes - mind you Julie Bishop is growing in stature here and overseas - don't rule it out.,35,TimOfAltona
577,I guess a country with a population of 15.5m people can absorb a paltry few hundred people - particularly as the Australian government is covering the cost of their resettlement. ,31,TimOfAltona
578,If Labor are to have any chance in 2016 they need to ditch their reliance on the Greens to get them over the line - this is where it all starts to go pear shape because  the Greens Labor can't get the numbers so 2016 will be a choice between the incumbent Coalition and another Labor/Greens cabal. ,59,TimOfAltona
579,Abbott's use of the 'Light on the Hill' analogy was a masterstroke. ALP should be incredibly proud it took a conservative PM to quote Ben Chifley at a UN General Assembly address.  ,34,TimOfAltona
580,"C'mon Ian, you and I both know that is not true. This government has steady hand and we will all emerge from this period in an ok state. Keeping Australia's economy on track is the key to social, economic and political stability. ",43,TimOfAltona
581,"Rest assured, Labor will eventually rebuild, though it is some years off yet, and will once more occupy the Treasury benches (although the leadership &amp; front bench by then will have changed considerably from what we see today). ",39,TimOfAltona
582,"I wouldn't be too hard on Shorten - the Abbott government is showing strong leadership over these issues - Labor has no choice but to stay with the government or else they will end up being perceived, like the Greens, as largely irrelevant when it comes to national security and fighting terrorism - this in turn guarantees successive Coalition governments in power for the next few years. Albo would be doing the same thing if was LOTO in my opinion.",80,TimOfAltona
583,Good comment. The left use that term to try and land blows against the government - in fact it shows up their ignorance - nothing can compare to the abject horrors of WWII concentration camps. ,36,TimOfAltona
584,The situation on Manus or Nauru is far from ideal and eventually these centres will be emptied &amp; closed down (what will the Greens have to complain about then?) but the undeniable fact is that perhaps hundreds of lives have been spared from drowning since the government delivered on it's pre-election promise.why is this fact always ignored/overlooked by the Labor/Greens cheer squad? ,63,TimOfAltona
585,"In the meantime, these allegations of self-harm and impropriety need to be investigated as well as serious allegations that some STC employees were actively engaged in encouraging detainees to fabricate abuse.",31,TimOfAltona
586,"I think the left already suspect the next election is beyond them - this government, with or without Abbott as PM will likely go for at least another 2 terms. ",31,TimOfAltona
587,"You are right in that Iraq and Syria is a distraction from domestic politics and it is not only the government that is hidden, but also very much the Labor opposition. I think both sides of politics would prefer we did not have to deal with ISIS.",47,TimOfAltona
588,Funny how the left  see the Abbott government at fault here - but ignore Labor who would be going down the same path if they were in government. ,30,TimOfAltona
589," - In the ""face of evil,"" nations of good conscience do have a responsibility to act.""I reconfirmed to the Prime Minister, Labor's support for this important development.""When it comes to fighting terror, Labor and the government are working together."" ",41,TimOfAltona
590,The families wanted a RC into the circumstances around the deaths of their children to help provide closure and determine the sequence of events that lead to the multiple tragedies.  ,32,TimOfAltona
591,My point is valid - so many Labor/Greens supporters are more concerned about the prospect of a rise in the government's popularity than they are in the genocide occurring on a daily basis in Nth Iraq and Syria. ,39,TimOfAltona
592,"QLD Labor suffers from the same disease inflicting federal Labor - Poor leadership, reliance on disreputable unions and cosying up to the Greens to try and get across the line. ",31,TimOfAltona
593,Labor and their supporters need to seriously look at internal party reform if they are to have any hope over the next few years - confected attacks against Abbott or Newman is not the strategy you need to win back government..,41,TimOfAltona
594,"I'm confused - when Newspoll shows Qld Labor are in front, all the Labor supporters applaud the result as proof that Labor will win the next election and Newman is finished - but when Newspoll shows the Newman government are in front of Labor, according to the Labor supporters (see plenty below), Newspoll is immediately transformed into a Murdoch conspiracy to keep the LNP in government and should be totally disregarded. ",72,TimOfAltona
595,You may be a bit confused - Defence Dept and C'wealth Health have provided that advice to the government...it was not the government's decision. The minister is acting on advice from the experts.,33,TimOfAltona
596,This decision was made by both the Defence Dept and the Commonwealth Health Dept who duly advised the government of the day - I'm fairly certain the same decision would have been forthcoming if it was a Labor government and a Labor government would likewise be heeding the expert advice from Health and Defence.,54,TimOfAltona
597,"...or my personal favourite from the Australian left - If Tony Abbott was  Australian PM, everyone would be living in peace and harmony in the Middle East. That one's a doozy.",32,TimOfAltona
598,I think there is a bit of confusion over the interpretation of Abbott's comments - he was referring to foreign citizens temporarily visiting Australia specifically to preach hate and division amongst minority communities. ,34,TimOfAltona
599,"Where the airstrikes are very useful is targeting IS vehicle movements between towns - they move in convoys in utes, 4WD's, captured humvees, captured Iraqi tanks and armoured vehicles as they go from town to town. ",37,TimOfAltona
600,"Gaza was not genocide. The civilian deaths occurred in Gaza when Hamas fired their rockets into Israel from civilian populated locations, hoping to draw Israeli fire and the ensuing deaths delivered great propaganda for their cause. ",37,TimOfAltona
601,Actually Johnston was fairly impressive on Insiders this morning. Admittedly he has not had the highest of profiles since the coalition came to government but he acquitted himself well today and seemed well on top of his brief. ,39,TimOfAltona
602,The issue is significantly broader than your narrow perspective - there is a genocide occurring here and it will take some considerable money from the west and middle eastern countries to put a halt to this horror. ,38,TimOfAltona
603,You can't help but have compassion for this person and hope he survives but the reality is there are hundreds of thousands of Zainullah Naseris' who would try to get to Australia if they thought they could circumnavigate the UNHCR process and get here by boat via people smugglers. ,50,TimOfAltona
604,"We have been down that track already under Rudd and look at the result - hundreds drowned at sea, detention centres filled to capacity and people smugglers getting very very wealthy. ",32,TimOfAltona
605,I suspect some of the Labor supporters accusing Abbott of reneging on the G20 are a bit confused here - it is not Australia's decision whether to ban Putin from visiting the G20 or not - it is up to other G20 members to deny him a seat at the table - it is not up to Tony Abbott nor would it be up to Shorten if he were PM. ,71,TimOfAltona
606,"I think Daisy while we all recognise the government will be returned in 2016, even the most ardent LNP supporter would not disagree that some seats will be dropped to the ALP. ",33,TimOfAltona
607,There is only so much lipstick you can apply to the Labor Party pig - reality is the current government will be returned in 2016 albeit with a reduced majority in the Lower House. ,35,TimOfAltona
608,Labor will need to go through 2 or 3 more leadership changes before they will be competitive once more - I seriously doubt the next Labor PM is even in parliament yet.,32,TimOfAltona
609,Every PM Labor or Liberal or in-between are booed at sporting events - go back and look at the Gillard and Rudd appearances at major sporting events - it's an Australian sport. ,33,TimOfAltona
610,Herein lies the problem for Labor supporters - thinking that all you need to do is attack the PM &amp; the government will somehow get you into government is a fallacy and misguided - your biggest problem lies within - Labor are simply not up to the job - they will not be in government again until they sort out their major internal problems and then convince Australians they have it fixed. ,73,TimOfAltona
611,Labor's long rebuilding journey started September last year but little progress has been made because the three key factors that will keep Labor in Opposition for 2-3 terms have not been addressed - ,34,TimOfAltona
612,Unions - being held hostage by the unions who only represent a minority of Australians will keep Labor in opposition for years to come. The Gillard experiment is testament to that. ,32,TimOfAltona
613,Greens - hopping in and out of bed with the Greens is death for Labor. No-one wants another Labor/Greens government in this country. Labor have to find a way to rebuild without relying on the Greens to get them over the line. Can't see them breaking away any time soon.  ,52,TimOfAltona
614,"The Turks are formidable fighters - they can easily rescue the town. It is in their interests to do so - keep the border free of an ISIS base, allow the Kurds to remain in their town on the Syrian side of the border and prevent thousands of more Kurds crossing the border to live as refugees in Turkey.",59,TimOfAltona
615,"Given IS objective is to take control of large swarths of territory, including Turkish soil, probably best Turkey does all it can now to stop IS setting up a formidable base literally on Turkey's doorstep.",35,TimOfAltona
616,"Instead of having their troops and tanks lined up at the border just watching, a few hundred metres away from Kobani, the Turks need to move in a push IS out of the town. ",35,TimOfAltona
617,I'm with you - the Gillard v Rudd civil wars that almost destroyed the Labor party has nothing to do with peoples' opinions on politicians at all - it is all the Coalition's fault.,34,TimOfAltona
618,Jim valid point - but northern Iraq is a very large area and getting increasingly crowded with allied air power carrying out bombing attacks- I doubt the information being released is giving IS any heads up on RAAF operational activity and it is always some time after the event as well.,51,TimOfAltona
619,I'd like to hear from the terrorists on thisdo they feel the government has gone too far and would like the laws softened to make it easier to plan attacks and the like? ,34,TimOfAltona
620,People smugglers continually look for ways to get their business model kick started again - if there was any hint that woman arriving pregnant by boat in Australia would be a pathway to getting into Australia for their baby and themselves then standby for hundreds of pregnant asylum seekers departing Indonesia. It's just the way it is.,57,TimOfAltona
621,It appears the left-wing cheer squad have completely forgotten about the MH17 tragedy such is their enthusiasm to demonise Abbott at any opportunity they completely forget that many Australians lost their lives on that plane and there are hundreds of relatives grieving. Abbott is saying exactly the right thing in relation to Putin's attendance at the G20 - something tells me if he said nothing the lefties would be attacking him for being a wimp and ignoring the relatives of those who perished on the flight.,86,TimOfAltona
622,I suspect even the most ardent of the regular anti-Abbott brigade on here recognise that not much would be happening in our world without coal production -unless we go nuclear - now there's a thought.,35,TimOfAltona
623,Shorten has backed himself into a very tight corner over a banking RC - he has to stay the course now because a sensible backdown will hand a major victory to the government. ,34,TimOfAltona
624,"1. Sinodinos has the smarts and political nous to single handedly destroy any slim hopes Labor had of falling over the line at an election.Labor are well aware of this, hence they are targeting him hoping he can't do them too much tactical damage as chief advisor to the PM. ",51,TimOfAltona
625," The extent of that reduction will be played out in coming weeks as no doubt with such a protracted campaign, there will be bloopers committed by both sides and eagerly picked up by the media hoardes.  ",39,TimOfAltona
626,"You are attacking highly experienced and professional political journalists who report what they see and hear and btw, Katharine is considerably closer to action in Canberra than you would ever be sitting in some dark place on a keyboard spouting hatred and bile towards the government. JS.",47,TimOfAltona
627,"The rest are all on about Turnbull and the LNP being smashed, Labor enjoying a landslide victory, the LNP being wiped out, Turnbull won't lead the Liberals to the election, Shorten is a certainty for next PM etc etc etc ",41,TimOfAltona
628,If this trio seriously think they can win an election against the government with everything that's stacked against the return of a Labor/Greens government then they are massively deluded. ,30,TimOfAltona
629,Problem Labor has is that they are joined at the hip with the CFMEU (seen the latest ads?) and people are not too wrapped with the idea that the CFMEU could be governing the nation.,35,TimOfAltona
630,"That said, it's hard these days to see who's propping up who - the unions propping up the ALP (as evidenced by CFMEU ads) or the ALP propping up the unions (as evidenced by Shorten's TWU legislation killed off last night), looks like they prop each other up. ",49,TimOfAltona
631,"You seem a bit confused here - no election will be called until after the budget is handed down, so no point writing 100 times a day that Turnbull hasn't called an election yet.",34,TimOfAltona
632,You seem to forget the Cayman Island tactic Labor tried to use early on in the piece was dropped like a hot potato when it backfired spectacularly on Shorten. ,30,TimOfAltona
633,The R/G/R Labor years saw tens of millions of tax payer (borrowed) funds propping up the ALP propaganda machine. Gillard spent something like $20m alone on advertising her carbon tax broken promise. Gillard also spent around $73m tax payers money on ALP (government) advertising for the 2010 election. ,49,TimOfAltona
634,They are all trying to be the first to report that the government is going to a DD election - hence government ministers are holding their cards close to their chest. ,32,TimOfAltona
635,"Abbott went to an election promising a RC into union corruption if he gained government. Last I looked, he had a landslide victory and the ALP were left with a handful of seats in the lower house - so Abbott delivered on what we voted for - a RC into union corruption. ",53,TimOfAltona
636,If Shorten can do the same with the promise of a RC into the B&amp;F sector then good luck to him. I don't think he can pull it off now that the government look like increasing resources and legislative powers for ASIC.,42,TimOfAltona
637,"Supporters of the Labor/Greens party are quick to hop on board their leader's focus group initiated and populist call for a RC into the banking and finance sector - for no other reason than they think that by joining two themes, a Royal Commission and Banking and Finance Sector, it will equate to more votes for their beleaguered party. ",60,TimOfAltona
638,"With no terms of reference offered, no time frames, no money allocated and no idea who would run it, it all sounds and looks like a focus group thought bubble of gigantic proportions. ",34,TimOfAltona
639,I think you are correct. The Turnbull government will be returned with a reduced majority in the lower house. Let's hope the senate is cleaned out of the preference whisperer senators which also will give the government clear air in the senate to do what we elect them to do - govern.,52,TimOfAltona
640,"However, with such a long campaign and the media watching every word and gesture and hoping for a stumble by the key players, particularly Shorten and Turnbull, anything can happen along the way, but you'd have to surmise Turnbull will prevail and be given another term.",46,TimOfAltona
641,"Fair to say, the ALP engage in crass and gutter politics . It has been their MO since the drubbing in 2013 and we have seen this played out in various formats since and clearly evidenced in their crass behaviour in both houses of parliament. ",46,TimOfAltona
642,You need to speak to the unions about why vehicle manufacturing is almost extinct in SA - they know a thing or two about forcing manufacturers to abandon Australia in favour of lower cost overseas markets.,36,TimOfAltona
643,The question is - can Plibersek even hold her seat? The Greens look like they will steam roll over her - unless the Libs come to her rescue with their preferences.,31,TimOfAltona
644,Cash is spot on regarding the CFMEU and the way it props up the Labor Party - their latest attack ads on TV are a great reminder for Australians why we don't want another CFMEU controlled Labor government in office for another few terms.,44,TimOfAltona
645,"Please explain when the polls show the government ahead they are nothing more than a media conspiracy to protect the government, yet when the same polls are favourable to Labor/Greens they are a true indication of how voters are feeling? ",41,TimOfAltona
646,They have never delivered on their promise of reform and rebuild and clearly it will take another election drubbing for them to seriously sort out what they stand for and what direction they want to take the party - starting with ditching Bingle Bill and the hapless Plibersek and starting afresh.,51,TimOfAltona
647,"C'mon Daisy, you know Cash was referring to national numbers, this was a rally in Camberra where only a few hundred attended. It's difficult for most of them to attend such a rally because the ALP and the TWU have all but driven their businesses to the wall so they have to work 7 days to keep their heads above water.",61,TimOfAltona
648,Don't be taken in by TWU (and Labor) propaganda. Nothing to do with safety it's all about artificially inflating road transport costs to the benefit of TWU members and to the detriment of owner drivers and consumers.,37,TimOfAltona
649,"Labor are so hobbled by their union masters, TWU in this case, that they will go limping to the election with Turnbull's Truckies vowing support for LNP candidates - that's how many hundred thousand voters?",35,TimOfAltona
650,Always good to see you have such a big interest in the Wayside Chapel - you should do some volunteering work down there then you can rightfully claim you and the Australian PM have something in common.,37,TimOfAltona
651,"Nonsense, she could have left all the Labor MPs who were flouting standing orders in the house and it still makes no difference to voting, Labor have such a piss poor number of seats in the lower house after the R/G/R debacle.",42,TimOfAltona
652,Plenty of people sympathise with her when she was speaker.Certain labor MPs were carrying on like primary school children - fully deserved to be thrown out for flouting standing orders.In fact it looked as if some of them were going for the all time ejection record so they were baiting her. Not a good look for a party who are supposedly the alternative government.,64,TimOfAltona
653,Not at all. Reality is Malcolm Turnbull's government is strengthened by this generational change. Perhaps that what has Labor and its supporters so vocal about the outcome. You would suspect they were all hoping Bronwyn would be contesting the next election but have had the rug pulled out from under them. Hence a big win for the government.,58,TimOfAltona
654,She will be remembered as a powerhouse politician and a formidable Lower House speaker who had to deal with the childish antics of a Labor opposition reeling from the devastating drubbing at the 2013 election who were intent on causing disruption and mayhem by systematically flouting standing orders in order to gain attention for their wounded party. ,58,TimOfAltona
655,This was reflected in the sheer number of recalcitrant Labor MPs thrown out of the house . It was clear what Labor tactics were and in some ways Bronwyn could be criticised for showing too much restraint in disciplining regularly offending Labor MPs. These MPs turned the House of Reps into a circus and did their party and the parliament no favours - hopefully their constituents will remember the childish antics and vote accordingly at the next election.,78,TimOfAltona
656,"The Greens by and large represent the nation's social conscience - this does not always fit in too well with the competing agendas of the two major parties, particularly where fiscal policy is concerned. ",35,TimOfAltona
657,"I think she knows in the back of her mind that Labor have to serve at least one more term, perhaps two, in opposition and she has yet to decide if she wants to part of all that.",38,TimOfAltona
658,When the PM is out of the country it is customary for the Deputy PM to take over as acting PM to keep the business of government ticking over. ,30,TimOfAltona
659,This is despite the fact that Bingle Bill is about as popular as Michaelia Cash would be if she were to drop in and bang out a few verses of the Liberal Party hymn for the boys at a CFMEU picket line...... ,43,TimOfAltona
660,Despite the fact that Australians have little interest in watching the prime ministerial revolving door popping out yet another Australian PM (how many is that in the past 9 years?)....... ,31,TimOfAltona
661,Despite the fact that voters are weary about installing yet another Labor/Greens government after the trainwreck of last time around that left Labor/Greens with a paltry 55 + 1 seats vs 90 for the government in the lower house. ,40,TimOfAltona
662,"Now  has got it wrong and I think we all know the reality is the ALP are well and truly the underdogs here and providing Turnbull doesn't stroll into the chamber sporting a top hat and smoking an expensive Cuban over the next few weeks , Labor are set to remain the underdogs for another term at least IMO. ",61,TimOfAltona
663,Clearly the ALP tactics committee decided to have this smoke and mirrors hollow 'announcement' broadcast on the very day the PM is up in China securing Australia's trade future with an economy 4 times larger than Australia's. ,38,TimOfAltona
664,"Well, we all know that 'free range' has wildly differing interpretations, we know that 'barn laid' are god awful conditions for the chickens and then at the bottom of the rung are just 'normal' eggs - what cruel and tortuous conditions are those chickens in?",45,TimOfAltona
665,Problem is railfreight is considerably more expensive than road freight and guess who ends up paying for the increased transport/supply costs - standby for massive price hikes on the supermarket shelves.,31,TimOfAltona
666,"It certainly worked for my Dad, we knew almost to the minute when he would pass based on the dose of morphine the nurses had administered to ease his suffering.",30,TimOfAltona
667,"This is akin to the robots working the assembly lines which used to be manned by skilled workers in car manufacturing - investment in technology increases production, improves efficiency and reduces cost and the robots rarely go on strike over job security. ",43,TimOfAltona
668,"My, hasn't the former darling of the Labor cheer squad, based for no other reason than at some point he took on the Liberal Party has fallen from grace. ",30,TimOfAltona
669,"Distinctly recall commenting at the time that Clive was in it for Clive and nothing else, yet so many Labor supporters had him up on a pedestal like their new messiah. ",32,TimOfAltona
670,How about a RC into how it came to pass that Biff Teacup was 'inserted' as ALP leader ahead of the bloke who pretty much everyone voted for to lead the party? ,33,TimOfAltona
671,Uber are probably providing a great public service here - a cunning way to let people know they are actually arseholes and giving them an opportunity to lift their game by improving their net rating.,35,TimOfAltona
672,"Certainly Shorten's dealings with EastLink over the AMW member ripoff was not a good look, nor were the 100 or so pending prosecutions emanating from the TURC, nor were the Health Services Union crash and burn a good look. ",40,TimOfAltona
673,"Not sure what will bring on the demise of the reef faster, climate change or people, mainly tourists, destroying parts of the reef each day by standing up on the coral in their flippers in the shallower water.  ",40,TimOfAltona
674,These are mostly the thousands of amateur snorkelers who travel out on tour boats to sections of the reef each week and swarm all over the reef inflicting irreparable damage. ,31,TimOfAltona
675,"The tour companies will deny that is the case as they warn their punters not to stand on the coral, but on the two occasions I've been out I've seen plenty of amateur snorkelers standing up and breaking the fragile coral formations. ",43,TimOfAltona
676,It means as a nation we should not be spending more than we are earning or borrowing more than we can afford to repay - simple fiscal responsibility seemingly lost on Bill Shorten as he travels around the country throwing (promised) money at anything that moves to buy votes for the ALP ahead of the election. ,57,TimOfAltona
677,Something tells me that if you had been fortunate in life like Turnbull and had amassed personal wealth and then entered politics and and became a minister of the crown and eventually Prime Minister you would be doing exactly what Turnbull has done - keeping his investments which may include Australian businesses at arms length where he can't be accused of conflict of interest but still pay Australian taxes. ,70,TimOfAltona
678,I can see the roar of disapproval from the Labor cheer squad now if Turnbull in his capacity as PM was seen to knowingly personally benefit from government policy or actions within a certain sector or enterprise. ,38,TimOfAltona
679,"Well comrade, I think you will find that Turnbull knows a thing or two about being an underdog. You have no idea about the work he's done for decades with homeless and disadvantaged people have you? ",37,TimOfAltona
680,Shorten got the name 'Bingle Bill' when he drove around a quiet Carlton Street early one Sunday morning smashing into parked cars - he claimed he spilt hot coffee in his lap. ,33,TimOfAltona
681,Shorten and the ALP's tactic seems to be promise cash to anyone who holds out their hand and worry about it later if they happen to fall over the line. ,31,TimOfAltona
682,"As opposed to living outside our means which seems to be the Labor party mantra this election, if Bill's promises of cash splash for all is anything to go by. ",31,TimOfAltona
683,"My money is on the left faction to get up and install Albo, but that could be complicated if Plibersek holds her seat, which means she'll have to be shafted for someone from the right to replace her as deputy. No idea who that could be but. Your guess as good as mine.",53,TimOfAltona
684,"Turnbull is not alone in thinking the Gillard years were a dud - ask Bill Shorten, he thought Gillard was so much of a dud he stabbed her in the back and installed Kevin Rudd. ",36,TimOfAltona
685,"So desperate is he to win government he must be furiously watering that magical ALP money tree growing out the back of Trades Hall, for that's about the only way he can deliver on all these cash giveaways.",38,TimOfAltona
686,"With the nations money pool rapidly evaporating due to lower commodity prices and the slowing economies of our major trading partners, not all requests for increased government handouts can be accommodated. ",32,TimOfAltona
687,"The hundreds of thousands of drivers who use the Monash each day don't care where the money comes from, they just need it fixed and will probably give cudos to the government that achieves that for them. ",38,TimOfAltona
688,"Firstly, congratulations on managing to post a comment without referring to the Cayman Islands and secondly, all these funding for road infrastructure improvement announcements are music to the ears for anyone who has to drive the Monash peak hour carpark each day. ",43,TimOfAltona
689,Not at all Daisy - purely pointing out the bloody obvious that it is not only Liberal party politicians who claim back expenses attending Liberal Council meetings as this Dragon dude is alluding - Labor pollies claim back their expenses when attending Labor Council meetings - it's part of their job description to attend. ,55,TimOfAltona
690,"The previous Liberal government initiated plans for an airport rail link to the city but the Andrews Labor government came in and threw them out, preferring a widening of the Tullamarine freeway to ease congestion. ",36,TimOfAltona
691,"No wonder the Victorian government have welcomed this announcement as will anyone who has to drive on the Monash each day, that's a few hundred thousand voters right there. ",30,TimOfAltona
692,"When you guys break for play lunch, have a bit of a brainstorming session amongst yourselves on how you can perhaps bring some facts to the table instead of relying on a few of Shorten's old zingers to prosecute your argument. ",42,TimOfAltona
693,"This 'event' was a Shorten inspired con, err..I mean 'Town Hall' meeting where he got to spruik focus group inspired rhetoric with no way of showing how he will pay for everything.",32,TimOfAltona
694,I urge you to hand over all your factual information to Guardian editors and the Federal police at the earliest opportunity so we can all share in your knowledge on these matters and legal proceedings can commence. ,38,TimOfAltona
695,Classic ALP electioneering focus group driven stunt by Shorten - tell everyone what he thinks they want to hear along with all the associated promises on what he will do with not a hope in hell of funding this stuff. ,41,TimOfAltona
696,In all seriousness it may not be a bad idea to put Tony back into the cabinet in the next term of government. He has proved himself to be head and shoulders above the Labor party when it comes to the Immigration and Border Protection portfolio and is generally credited here and abroad with shutting down the insidious and deadly people smuggling industry in this part of the world. ,70,TimOfAltona
697,"Given The Guardian are right in the action here, if there is anything damning relating to any Australian individuals or businesses we will be hearing all about it don't you think?",31,TimOfAltona
698,Ahhh...the usual bullshit manoeuvring tactics being trotted out by the hapless Tony Burke trying to both disrupt and score cheap political points in an election year. Fools no one what he is up to.,34,TimOfAltona
699,"When you have finished that, come back and explain how naval shipbuilding is still in limbo given the Abbott government confirmed last year the next generation of surface vessels will all be constructed in SA along with a boost of billions of dollars to the local economy. ",48,TimOfAltona
700,"Taking into consideration the leaders of the two major parties plus the Greens, which leader would you be most likely to welcome into your home for dinner and conversation, Turnbull, Shorten, Di Natale or none of them ",38,TimOfAltona
701,"I see all the resident fiscal wizards from the Labor cheer squad are giving free advice to the PM on how he should be managing his personal financial affairs.....it's very noble of them to give the PM a few pointers on how to maximise his already considerable wealth, but something tells me he's doing just fine without their misguided yet well meaning suggestions. ",64,TimOfAltona
702,"Bottom line is Turnbull's personal financial affairs are no ones business except his own - if he is breaking the law, which he is not, then that's another matter.  ",31,TimOfAltona
703,"Yes, global warming is real and yes average temperatures have been slowly rising on the planet for the last 100 years or so (when reliable monitoring was first in place), although Camden outside Sydney recorded a 50C day in 1896 which has never been repeated since. ",47,TimOfAltona
704,"At any examination, Australia with our paltry 1.8% contribution to the planet's greenhouse gas emissions is not the problem here, that would be China (by far), United States, India, Russia and Japan. ",33,TimOfAltona
705,"Australia keeping it's coal in the ground is not going to restrict China and India or other high emission countries from continuing with an insatiable appetite for cheap coal powered energy, they will simply source from elsewhere if Australia denys supply. ",42,TimOfAltona
706, So for now the economic benefits for Australia (just ask the QLD Labor government re Adani and the thousands of blue collar Labor voters and their families dependant on coal exports in Newcastle) outweigh the moral and perhaps scientific argument for keeping our coal in the ground. ,49,TimOfAltona
707,Too simplistic? Perhaps but I don't think Australia can keep looking the other way when the topic of nuclear powered energy comes up. We probably have the best environmental conditions on the planet to operate nuclear power stations in a safe and sustainable way.,44,TimOfAltona
708,"Capricornia has been a safe Labor seat since Federation. It has only been after the landslide defeats of Whitlam, Keating and Rudd that the LNP took control of the seat. ",31,TimOfAltona
709,"Just as the government's honeymoon period was unsustainable, so is the opposition's current poll driven sugar hit seemingly getting them over excited...even Mr Bean (Sam Dastyari) came out yesterday announcing that Labor are almost certain of a victory. ",39,TimOfAltona
710,I think we can all agree that Turnbull's initial 'honeymoon' burst of popularity was unsustainable - it was so far up in the stratosphere vs Shorten's being below seabed level that we all recognised it was artificially high. ,39,TimOfAltona
711,"That said, Turnbull can't sit back and relax thinking he will have a comfortable win...he has plenty of hard work ahead of him before the election and the winning formula for him is to revisit the 'fairness' he spruiked on becoming PM. ",43,TimOfAltona
712,"The issue at hand is where the funding comes from. He proposed the states fund their own public education via state raised taxation, whereas the premiers didn't want to go down that track because they are made to look like the villains of the piece in raising taxes - they want the commonwealth to take the heat on that. ",60,TimOfAltona
713,"No one could disagree with your 4th paragraph, but it is where the money comes from and given it is an ever shrinking pool of funds, it's how it is distributed that is in contention here. ",37,TimOfAltona
714,Labor have a bad habit of promising way more than is available in the pool and then they promise to distribute it where they think it will garner them most votes - placing the interests of their party ahead of the interests of the Australian community.,46,TimOfAltona
715,Now come back and explain to us how a senior government minister and now the PM can invest his personal funds in Australian businesses and then not be accused of passing legislation that benefits himself financially? ,37,TimOfAltona
716,There are clear double standards here - many of the Labor cheer squad are labelling private school education as being 'elitist' and not worthy of public funding and some are even advocating closing them down altogether. ,37,TimOfAltona
717,"It's a funny thing, the bloke who is their leader and they are campaigning for so hard to be the next PM is himself the product of a very exclusive and expensive private school education. ",36,TimOfAltona
718,The same applies to the daily demonisation of the 'evil' IPA. The bloke who is the leader of the Labor cheer squad and they are campaigning for so hard to be he next PM is himself a close personal friend of the IPA chief and worse than that was also best man at his wedding. ,56,TimOfAltona
719,I've been to Cuba on three occasions now and each time it is looking more run down and more people living in about as close to poverty as you get without the starvation. Large swaths of the capital Havana have no running water and electricity cuts in and out on a daily basis. ,54,TimOfAltona
720,"Until then it's more of the same ALP smoke and mirrors - just like the billions Gillard promised which, surprise surprise, the bulk of which were only due to come to fruition beyond the then forward estimates ie: the money promised was an aspiration, it was never there in the first place. ",53,TimOfAltona
721,"No way could you ever trust Labor with their hollow claims on public school education funding, it's all a case of telling you what you want to hear with no way to actually deliver on the promises IMHO.",38,TimOfAltona
722,It would be great to hear from you on what more can be done today that has not already been done to rectify injustices and assist indigenous Australians to share equally in Australia's prosperity? ,35,TimOfAltona
723,"Felt sorry for Amanda last night, she was sent in there to try and prop up Labor's great con on the $30bn dollars 'promised' for education that never existed and could not be funded in the first place. ",39,TimOfAltona
724,This is something I can't understand. You claim to idolise Gillard yet the very person who delivered the final backstab to toss Gillard out of the top job and essentially assign her to the political scrap heap was Bill Shorten. ,41,TimOfAltona
725,"Bill Shorten came out and categorically stated there is nothing to see at all with Malcolm Turnbull's personal financial affairs - geeze, I'll even find the link and post it for you - he said Turnbull has done nothing illegal or untoward with his tax arrangements and conceded he was correctly paying his Australian taxes on overseas investments. ",59,TimOfAltona
726,"Your constant efforts in trying to build an imaginary bridge between the Panama Papers and the PM are doomed to crash and burn, a bit like the Labor party at the next election IMO.",34,TimOfAltona
727,Not ONE comment today how Newspoll is nothing more than a Murdoch conspiracy to keep the LNP in government - that is both refreshing and a giant step forward for the Labor/Greens cheer squad. ,35,TimOfAltona
728,"Now, let's keep that lack of accusations against Newspoll going when the next poll to come out showing the government has regained the lead and Turnbull's popularity has increased. ",30,TimOfAltona
729,I go where the bookies go and also with yesterday's Fairfax Poll which shows the government would have a comfortable win if an election were held today.....why? Because all the polls consistently show that Turnbull is preferred PM over Shorten by 2 to 1 (there's a trend for you) and given that Australians are sick and tired of revolving door PM's (on par with Italy) there is little prospect of the door spinning again and out pops Bingle Bill for his turn.,82,TimOfAltona
730,"Mind you, yesterday's Fairfax poll had the government comfortably ahead of Labor on a 2 PP and Turnbull streets ahead of Shorten as preferred PM, so hang in there Albo and Labor's left faction, there's still hope for you yet!",40,TimOfAltona
731,In many ways you make a lot of sense with that comment. The same applies to the revolving door of Australian PM's for the past 10 years - I think we're ahead of Italy in PM turnover of late. A bit of a laughing stock at any examination. How many Australian PMs' has Obama hosted at the White House during his presidential term? ,64,TimOfAltona
732,Precisely why voters are in no mood to see yet another change in the PM. Turnbull will get at least another full term to implement reform and bring stability to government. Even better if he doesn't need to herd cats in the senate anymore to get legislation through.,48,TimOfAltona
733,"Here's a tip.......Shorten tried and then crashed and burned with that tactic when Turnbull ascended to the top job. In fact he he realised it had backfired on Labor he came out and said the PM has done nothing wrong, illegal or underhanded in his personal financial affairs.  ",50,TimOfAltona
734,"Yes we all know that Turnbull both facilitates and pays Australian taxes on his investments through the Cayman Islands, just like tens of thousands of others, including superannuation funds. ",30,TimOfAltona
735,"This is in part because of potential conflict of interest pertaining to his role as both a senior government minister and then PM. He needs to keep his local investments at arms length and have them managed for him, much like we all do with superannuation funds. ",48,TimOfAltona
736,Largely off the back of falling global commodity prices - it's how this conundrum is handled which sits at the core of which party is best equipped to guide the country through falling revenues and increased government spending on health and education. ,43,TimOfAltona
737,Not at all. Dio Wang understands that the government is not going to individually negotiate with all 8 cross benchers - consensus will never be reached - akin to hearding cats. ,32,TimOfAltona

739,Something tells me Dennis Jensen's fury is nothing compared to the Labor/Greens cheer squad who like to dine out on the notion that it is only the LNP who like to roll around in coal mines.,36,TimOfAltona
740,It'll be a shame in a way if the cross benchers cave into self interest to protect their skin and give the government the numbers to pass the legislation. ,30,TimOfAltona
741,The DD will in all probability deliver government back to the Turnbull administration so he can get on with enacting the necessary reform measures plus enjoying an internal mandate to boot. ,32,TimOfAltona
742,I think Aussies get it that Turnbull needs a strong win to consolidate his position for the next 6 years or so. In the meantime the ALP can go about arranging their promised (never delivered) reform and rebuild under a new leadership team.,43,TimOfAltona
743,"Let's get this straight, it was never there to fund in the first place. It was an aspiration borne out of a fractured COAG meeting that had most premiers scratching their heads over who/what/where was the money ever coming from in the first place.",44,TimOfAltona
744,The states have no right to demand increased taxation from the Commonwealth to fund their schools and hospitals when they are unwilling to implement themselves to try and safeguard their own electoral viability.,33,TimOfAltona
745,Labor turn their back on Australian naval shipbuilding during their 6 long years in government and Bingle Bill has the audacity or should we say hypocrisy to accuse the government of doing nothing to support Australian shipbuilding. ,38,TimOfAltona

747,"Fairly safe to say Lenore will be the Labor cheer squad darling today......which will all change as soon as she reports on a negative about Shorten or the ALP, then she will morph into a News Ltd apologist. ",39,TimOfAltona
748,On the surface it looks like it may not be a bad tactic for Labor - unless of course they have skeletons they don't want aired or uncovered in which case it's highly unlikely Labor will go down that track.,40,TimOfAltona
749,"Of course the Labor premiers had to follow Bill's scripting for every word they uttered, so putting their comments aside as irrelevant, it was a pretty good outcome today IMO.",30,TimOfAltona
750,So how come with 6 years of Labor government with Swanny telling us umpteen times he was going to deliver us a budget surplus with Gillard looking on nodding away in agreement that none of this was addressed? ,39,TimOfAltona
751,Australians are not interested in rewarding the ALP with another turn at government after the disaster of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years. On top of that the ALP union controlled factions went ahead and put their chief faceless back stabber in as leader over the person Labor members wanted - Albo. ,50,TimOfAltona
752,"This is exactly why Shorten has a popularity rating wallowing around somewhere on the ocean floor and unlikely to surface, something the Labor cheer squad seen totally oblivious to in their haste to demonise their arch enemy, the LNP. ",40,TimOfAltona
753,Voters will give the Turnbull administration another term in government to sort out the mess labor left us with and meanwhile Labor can go ahead and start their reform and rebuild with another leader.,34,TimOfAltona
754,"It was the logical step and until that happens, all governments, Liberal or Labor/Greens, will be struggling to get any sort of traction when it comes to funding health and education not to mention all the other worthwhile social services needing attention. ",43,TimOfAltona
755,"I keep harping on about NZ and I know it's a smaller population base etc, but they very successfully increased GST in two stages, 10 to 12.5% then 12.5% to 15% and have never looked back. Also, in NZ it's broad based (on everything) and John Key even went to an election with a policy to increase GST to 15% and had a very comfortable win. ",67,TimOfAltona
756,No getting away from the fact that Gillard bluffed her way through that coag meeting which claimed $80bn in funding was headed to the states and was never there except in some pie in the sky unrealistic Labor party produced forward estimates. ,43,TimOfAltona
757,A positive outcome considering the Labor premiers are clearly being coached by Shorten relating to any statements they make (it is an election year after all). Turnbull was right to table the revised tax plan for evaluation and discussion - every option needs to be explored to fix the looming revenue shortfall. ,53,TimOfAltona
758,"The funny thing about political polls in Australia, the Left only accept/believe polls that show Labor/Greens improving or ahead and instantly dismiss any poll showing the opposite as bogus or a media conspiracy. ",34,TimOfAltona
759,"Presumably Bill has already got to the Labor premiers warning them not to publicly praise any aspect of the proposal (he was too late with the ACT Chief Minister) but the premiers are the best ones to decide if this has merit. There are certainly elements which will benefit the states, but some smaller states may feel disadvantaged. ",59,TimOfAltona
760,"Important as it is to many, it is not the main game in town for mainstream voters when they consider who is best equipped to take this country forward. ",30,TimOfAltona
761,"Working on the valid assumption that SSM will be legislated for whether an LNP or ALP/Greens government is in office, it's all in the timing from here, it is management of the economy that is the main game right now. ",41,TimOfAltona
762,"Who is best equipped to guide Australia through the rough and tumble of falling commodity prices and the weaker economies of our major trading partners - an ex-union hack who's only claim to fame is (apart from backstabbing two sitting Labor PM's) his performance in front of the cameras at the Beaconsfield mine disaster or a successful global businessman, lawyer and philanthropist turned politician taking this country down a centrist political path very similar to the long term government of John Key in NZ. ",85,TimOfAltona
763,"I think it's fair to say that any and all policies tabled by the government will be instantly consigned to the waste paper basket by the Labor cheer squad, irrespective of it's merits. ",34,TimOfAltona
764,It will be ratings winner for Sky. Even the Labor cheer squad will be signing up for Foxtel so they don't miss out on what promises to be unprecedented and riveting political debate. ,34,TimOfAltona
765,Overseas readers may be a little confused over this story - it appears for all the world like the Greens are in the running to form government after the next election and implement these policies. ,36,TimOfAltona
766,Perhaps not at strange as it may seem given the former Labor government invited the Greens into bed with them during the Gillard experiment coining the phrase a 'Labor/Greens government'. ,31,TimOfAltona
767,"Bottom line here, the ALP can never win government in this country again without being propped up by the Greens and the Greens will have little or no political clout, in the Lower House at least, without hopping back into bed with Labor. ",44,TimOfAltona
768,Expect to see the foreplay commence once the election date is set with Bill Shorten sending a bunch of red roses and a box of Cadbury Favourites over to Di Natali's pad with a note saying 'Let's catch up for a coffee - all is forgiven' ,47,TimOfAltona
769,Suggesting that persons over the age of 65 are senile is not a good look for the ALP supporters trying to grapple with the notion that Sophie may return to parliament. ,32,TimOfAltona
770,Let's hope Sophie has a solid win in Indi. The parliament has been poorer for her absence and she was a good performer for the LNP and the government will be richer if she returns to the front bench next term IMO. ,43,TimOfAltona
771,Kathy McGowan has been a fairly solid advocate for her seat but nothing beats the experience of Sophie and particularly if she returns to the inner sanctum of the government as the Member for Indi in addition to increasing the female representation in senior government ranks. ,47,TimOfAltona

773,"The mere fact that Windsor is the darling of the left, graphically illustrated within this thread, pretty much sums up his chances in NE against the Leader of the Nationals and Deputy PM.",33,TimOfAltona
774,"Barnaby Joyce is probably correct. Why else would Tony Windsor put himself through all this at his age? In the event Windsor wins he won't have the same clout he enjoyed whilst propping up a Gillard Labor government, he'll just be a single independent sitting up the back with zero influence on how the lower house votes and he won't be showered with benefits like he was by Gillard in order to keep her in government. ",77,TimOfAltona
775,Barnaby has actually done a pretty good job in his new role as National's leader and deputy PM....he's fairly safe in his seat you would think up against a proxy for the ALP in Windsor?,35,TimOfAltona
776,New England have not forgotten what Windsor did in defying his conservative voter base and hopping into bed with the disaster of a Gillard government. No wonder he bailed out before the voters of NE could throw him out in 2013. ,42,TimOfAltona
777,"Most people know the ALP is a product of and largely controlled by the unions, so Billy boy has to choose his words very carefully else he be accused of running a protection racket for corruption and criminality within the union movement ( a bit like Julia Gillard blatantly protecting Craig Thompson during the Health Services saga). If Shorten brings on a DD because he fails to support the ABCC re-instatement I know which way the votes will go and it's unlikely to be good news for Labor.",88,TimOfAltona

780,It's stating the bleeding obvious Wyatt would not be critical of the government's NBN rollout - he's a junior minister who hopes to one day be a senior minister and no one expects him to destroy his career by being openly critical of the government's NBN rollout policy on Q&amp;A particularly in an election year.,55,TimOfAltona
781,"You watch the ABC more and learn something. As with Sky news, ABC have plenty of platforms representing opinions from the left and the right. You seem to want all the news broadcasts to offer up anti-government propaganda on a daily basis. ",43,TimOfAltona
782,In other words you want to see a constant barrage of everything negative about the LNP government - if you don't see a healthy diet of this on a daily basis the ABC are somehow pandering to the right. ,40,TimOfAltona
783,"Open your eyes, all the issues you list have been reported and at times discussed on the ABC in various formats - the fact that each news broadcast does not lead with a negative piece on the Liberal Party places them in the 'enemy' bin in your narrow mind.",49,TimOfAltona

797,I think voters all get it that a strong win for Malcolm will end the Abbott era and Turnbull's next term government will have both a mandate from the people and clear air within the party to resolve many outstanding issues and implement more centrist policies that will cement MT into a long serving Australian PM. ,57,TimOfAltona
798,Australians are sick and tired of revolving door PMs - time for some government and political stability. NZ have lead the way in this respect for years under the John Key administration. ,33,TimOfAltona

800,"The other problem you have is your ""Light on the Hill"" party all but snuffed out the light years ago and left you with a rump of a Labor Party a mere shadow of it's former glory. Some say Shorten is further to the right than Turnbull. ",48,TimOfAltona
801,"A good strong win to Turnbull will cement his administration into government for years to come - why? Because he will have the internal mandate to depart from the Abbott years and move forward with his centrist vision for Australia encompassing climate change, SSM and tax reform. ",48,TimOfAltona

812,"An interesting aside to this. I was at a McDonalds for lunch in Bangkok a couple of years ago and there was a table of secondary school 'girls' about 15 or 16 yrs old at the next table all kitted out in school uniform dresses, makeup and jewellery and makeup. They were not girls of course, but boys dressed as girls and obviously identifying as transgender at that age. Interesting because they were joined by other school students who were dressed in uniforms appropriate to their gender, boys and girls, and it looked like any other group of noisy school kids enjoying themselves at lunch at McDonalds.

858,"It is a little curious. I guess Abbott has a huge fan base in his electorate who were pissed when he lost the prime ministership. Does not mean they won't vote Liberal though. They want to see Abbott stay in parliament, even if it's on the back bench.",48,TimOfAltona
859,"Turnbull remains the peoples' choice for PM of this nation. He holds a commanding lead over his nearest rival, Bill Shorten. In fact Shorten's approval rating indicates he is the exact opposite to Turnbull ie: people don't want him as PM (Labor take note). ",45,TimOfAltona
860,"The LNP hold a 2PP lead over Labor - if an election were held today the Turnbull government would be comfortably returned. The other hidden danger for Labor is that if the Greens direct preferences away from Labor in certain seats, both Plibersek and Albo could be thrown out of parliament. The ALP stand to lose it's current senior team at the next election and with Shorten certain to stand down, it may be the catalyst for Labor to start it's promised but never delivered party reform. ",88,TimOfAltona
861,"Trust me, whether Barnaby holds his seat or does not means zip to the outcome of the election. Spinning your wheels over trying to prop up Tony Windsor is a fools game. The seat of NE will not determine the outcome of the election - your biggest problem is you have an unelectable leader in Bill Shorten. Until Labor face that fact a Labor/Greens government is but a wet dream for Labor supporters. ",74,TimOfAltona
862,PS - In a way it would be a win for the LNP if Barnaby were to lose his seat - it would deliver the country a deputy PM in Fiona Nash. ,33,TimOfAltona
863,I'm talking about polling - there is a definite pattern here - denounce any poll showing Labor falling away as fraudulent or a conspiracy and praise any poll that shows Labor improving. Either you believe in polling or you don't. ,41,TimOfAltona
864,I bow to your knowledge and experience and undying loyalty to the ALP...but here's a tip....denouncing Turnbull as a bag of wind isn't going to get Labor across the line this year nor is the fact that some of the Labor front bench have been around the block a couple times (those that survived all the knifings and resignations during the R/G/R train wreck) as many of them carry baggage especially your leader and deputy leader - saddle bags very full indeed. ,83,TimOfAltona
865,Smith trying to make a power grab in WA - he'd be better served going for Bingle Bill's job - couldn't be any less popular with the electorate and you never know he may give the ALP a boost in the polls.,42,TimOfAltona
866,A vote for Windsor is a vote for Labor. I think the conservative voters of NE won't want a fellow who pushed a toxic Gillard Labor government onto this country and then bailed out before he was pushed in 2013 to be rewarded with a seat. ,47,TimOfAltona
867,"Well, in 2013 we all thought we had put Labor out to pasture where they belonged, I guess this year gives us the opportunity to ensure they stay there - putting Labor candidates last will achieve that.",37,TimOfAltona
868,Pretty safe to say a vote for Joyce is a vote for Labor - so you don't have too much to worry about there - unless of course you reside in New England.,33,TimOfAltona
869,Good on him. He's in wth a good chance - it's not as if the minority Labor government have endeared themselves with voters - in fact the opposite. He would make an excellent MP for Queensland IMO.,37,TimOfAltona
870,The problem for them all is that government turned out to be the most unpopular government with the most unpopular PM the nation had ever experienced in Julia Gillard - the voters of New England will not forget that. ,40,TimOfAltona
871,The other issue for Windsor is he bailed out when everything went pear shaped for Labor he knew he didn't have a snowflakes chance in hell of holding his seat in the 2013 election so he jumped before he was pushed. ,42,TimOfAltona
872,The prospect of the Greens hopping out of the marital bed with Labor and having a few passionate dalliances with the Liberal party has Labor in a tail spin. ,30,TimOfAltona
873,"The danger of course is that if the Greens think the Libs performance in bed is better than that of their tired and worn out conjugal partner, then Labor will need more than viagra to entice the Greens back between the red satin sheets with the Eureka flag bedspread and the Solidarity Forever tune playing like an aphrodisiac in the background.  ",63,TimOfAltona
874,"Delicious isn't it - the prospect of the Greens and the Libs declaring their passion for each other and poor old Labor stuck loveless like a shag on a rock with no friends, no preferences and no hope of returning to government for a decade or more. ",48,TimOfAltona
875,"Hang on.....you are quoting Newspoll as a reliable barometer to back up your assertion Labor are about to win the election, yet when the very same Newspoll shows Labor drifting away it is nothing more than a Murdoch conspiracy to help the Libs stay in government and should be totally ignored. ",52,TimOfAltona
876,"July is looking good, the sooner that is done and dusted the sooner we can move forward with Abbott playing little or no role as a backbencher in the next Turnbull government and Malcolm with a mandate to move the government back towards the sensible centre. ",47,TimOfAltona
877,"Despite the bleatings and vitriol directed at him by the left, he calls a spade a spade and if he does not like the look of something he speaks his mind and has been extremely critical of some LNP government decisions in recent years. ",45,TimOfAltona

879,"I thought Michaela Cash was very impressive last night.

880,I thought Josh Zepps portrayal of Penny Wong as a wounded gazelle thrashing around at the watering hole when she came on a previous Q&amp;A supporting Julia Gillard's position on 'no' to same sex marriage was brilliant. ,38,TimOfAltona
881,The ALP who you have long been campaigning to return to government whilst totally ignoring their abject failures in both leadership and and looking for all the world as a mere proxy for the worst elements of the trade union movement. ,42,TimOfAltona
882,Time to admit that Labor have done precious little to implement party reform after their crushing defeat in 2013 and they have not yet earned the right to wiggle their way back into government purely off the back of a seemingly unpopular former Liberal leader in Abbott. ,48,TimOfAltona
883,Turnbull needs clear air to prosecute his centrist vision for government and I reckon Australians will give him the chance to deliver on that in his next term in government. ,31,TimOfAltona
884,"In the meantime Labor can resolve their leadership conundrum, get rid of Shorten and replace him with a leader who can lead the reform and rebuild and take the party forward.",31,TimOfAltona
885,I can understand why you dislike him - Tony was largely responsible for one of the most crushing defeats of any political party in the history of the country - it was a shellacking of Labor of the highest order and they'll take years to recover. ,47,TimOfAltona

889,Abbott is a sideshow to the main game and I hope Labor end up spinning their wheels over what may or may not have occurred while Abbott was PM and give Turnbull clear air to head to an election. ,40,TimOfAltona
890,Their beloved Labor Party PM's were never capable of fronting up to the Mardi Gras over all those years in government and it's taken a Liberal PM to be the first to achieve that feat. ,36,TimOfAltona

893,"If it said something like - I don't like reading and thinking about Julia Gillard's vag*** - when stories were coming out about her previous personal life, how long do you think it would last on here? ",38,TimOfAltona
894,Makes no difference one way or the other apart from giving the usual salacious gossip mongers material to propagate more hate against the former PM - as if extra-marital affairs only ever happen on the right side of politics. ,40,TimOfAltona
895,"I think Abbott's primary audience at the moment, apart from a media thirsty for headlines, are those around him who keep telling him he should stay and fight and win back Liberal leadership. ",34,TimOfAltona
896,"Go back and examine what Shorten said when he saw his Cayman Island tactic crumbling around him - ""I accept that Malcolm Turnbull's tax affairs are in order and he is paying his Australian taxes according to Australian taxation laws"" - or something to that effect. Go back and Google it to find it. ",55,TimOfAltona
897,Persisting with the fantasy that Turnbull is somehow avoiding his Australian taxation obligations does not do your side of the argument any favours. He pays significant amount of tax on his overseas earnings and investments.,35,TimOfAltona
898,"Dais, we can always count on you to paint the worst possible scenario with a bit of your own imagination and creativity thrown in to spice it up a bit. ",31,TimOfAltona
899,I doubt he was the individual behind the leak - too politically smart for that - it will be someone else and I think a certain former defence minister may know a bit more about it.,36,TimOfAltona
900,"You keep saying that, but we have yet to see a single poll anywhere that says Labor will win if an election were held today, in fact they say the opposite. In my view an election brought forward is in Turnbull's best interest and an election held later in the year won't favour the government so much - particularly if Tony Abbott continues to present himself as the defacto leader of the Liberal party.",74,TimOfAltona
901,Malcolm is now experiencing exactly what both Gillard and Rudd went through - a hardcore support base for their political 'rival' remained in government making outright criticism/discipline a difficult path to go down. ,34,TimOfAltona
902,Either way - as Labor learned the hard way 'party disunity is death' and admittedly they have disciplined themselves fairly well under Shorten to present a united front - they know only too well to do otherwise disqualifies them from forming government for years to come. ,47,TimOfAltona
903,"The only way to knock this on the head for the Libs at least, is for Tony to do an Albo and come out and publicly give his unqualified support for his leader and do it quickly.",37,TimOfAltona
904,Still maintain that a strong win to Malcolm will pretty much see the sun set on Abbotts political career and I think Australians will still deliver him that strong win.,30,TimOfAltona
905,"After watching Tony Abbott on Sky this morning addressing the Tasmanian Liberal function with Abetz, his speech sounded for all the world as if he was still PM and going into election mode vs Shorten - this is not helpful to Turnbull and someone needs to let Tony know that the leadership of the Libs is beyond him now - he had his turn, achieved some things but the baton has been handed to Turnbull to take the government forward for the next few years. ",86,TimOfAltona
906,The Labor cheer squad seem obsessed with the notion that Abbott is about to topple Turnbull and retake the Liberal leadership - ala Kevin Rudd and Labor in 2013. ,30,TimOfAltona
907,"You see, the reason Rudd was successful in retaking leadership was that the whole world could see Gillard was leading the Labor Party to perhaps it's greatest defeat ever, would have been lucky to come away with 30 seats in the lower house if she was still there on Election Day and she had lost the support of the majority of her party, including Shorten who delivered the final blow to metaphorically put her out of her misery. ",79,TimOfAltona
908,"Now contrast that with Malcolm Turnbull who's popularity as preferred PM remains up in the stratosphere, whilst his nearest opponent Shorten remains somewhere down in the gutter. It is true that the last few polls have cut back the government's 2PP lead, but that was to be expected and no one can predict for sure where it will head in coming months. ",63,TimOfAltona
909,"In this environment and given Abbott's extremely low popularity whilst he was PM (granted was still higher than Shorten's) but in particular the Abbott government's consistent bad polling, there ain't a snowflakes chance in hell of Abbott successfully removing Turnbull - not now not ever.",45,TimOfAltona
910,Confusion reigns down at ALP campaign HQ - could someone let David know that Howard and Costello are not even in parliament therefore ineligible for the PM or Treasurer gigs? ,31,TimOfAltona
911,"You forgot to mention the locust plagues, tidal waves, earthquakes, starvation, asteroids striking the Sydney CDB and every ones first born girl is barren. I'm pretty sure I also saw the sky falling in this morning - all as a result of a Labor/Greens government not being in power. ",50,TimOfAltona
912,"They can't believe their luck with the Abbott thing, but they are still well behind the eight ball when it comes to forming a government out of the next election so they don't have the luxury of playing around with political mind games. They have only one shot and it's do or die for Bingle Bill.",56,TimOfAltona
913,"Clearly the ALP are enjoying the post-Abbott settling in of the new Turnbull government and so they should, they went through the ringer themselves not that long ago in the post-Rudd settling in of the Gillard government and then the post-Gillard settling in of the Rudd government. ",48,TimOfAltona
914,Not easy for any new PM when the person he/she defeated is hanging around in the background and has the media following them around hanging off every word.  ,30,TimOfAltona
915,In some ways Gillard had it tougher with Rudd because she had elevated him to the cabinet to hopefully buy his silence but that backfired on her big time. ,30,TimOfAltona
916,"He did - now name us a Labor PM who managed to enjoy the confidence of the Australian people equal to or longer than John Howard. In fact any PM will do, Labor or Liberal. ",36,TimOfAltona
917,"Some would argue he loses his ability to work with all sides of politics, one of the keys to his success thus far. Labor are a very partisan mob in the senate and Dodson may find himself shackled to the Penny Wong party machine which won't be to his liking. ",51,TimOfAltona
918,That's all well and good. Wait until he finds himself shackled to the Penny Wong partisan Labor machine in the senate and he has to vote yes or no on something he personally disagrees with.,35,TimOfAltona
919,All this infighting within Labor is not a good look for Shorten who's been left holding the short straw to lead Labor to a highly probable loss at the election. (DD or otherwise). ,34,TimOfAltona
920,The roots of all this discontent goes back to the inability of the Labor party to set a reform agenda when they were smashed after the R/G/R civil war. ,30,TimOfAltona
921,"Bill promised it when he became leader (also under controversial circumstances) but has done little or nothing to resolve the deep seated factional tensions - if anything they may have escalated, surfacing in the past few days with Bullock, Gray and now the nomination of Dodson (not even an ALP member) to the senate ahead of the widely respected Louise Pratt.",61,TimOfAltona
922,Only the Labor cheer squad are pushing that barrow hoping it can save Labor from defeat -  stands a better chance of returning to lead the Labor Party than Tony Abbott has of leading the Libs again.,38,TimOfAltona
923,Already causing problems. Louise Pratt has a strong following and significant support within the ALP and Shorten's rushed tactic to try and shore up the indigenous vote has ruffled feathers. ,31,TimOfAltona
924,This has all the hallmarks of the Trish Crossin debacle in the NT where Gillard made a 'Captain's Pick' and dumped the highly respected Crossin in favour of Nova Perris.,30,TimOfAltona
925,Shorten always saw Abbott as his free ride to The Lodge - all Bill had to do was hang onto his position and 'be there' when the election came around and all would be rosy in Labor/ACTU land. ,39,TimOfAltona
926,"When he had his perceived 'free ride' so cruelly ripped out from under him, courtesy of the Liberal party room, he realised he had better do something and do something quickly before everything went down the gurgler for the Labor Party. ",42,TimOfAltona
927,He panicked and tried to label Turnbull as 'different' from the rest of us because he had been successful in life and had accumulated personal wealth...hoping it would resonate with voters not so fortunate...well it backfired within a couple of days as it evolved voters admired Turnbull for his success and pretty much everyone saw through what the hapless Shorten was attempting. Labor dropped the 'Cayman Island' tactic like a hot potato. ,73,TimOfAltona
928,"Knowing he was unable to beat Turnbull in the popularity stakes and with Albo and the left faction of the ALP bearing down on him, he embarked on a bold tactic to announce a contentious taxation policy around tinkering with the hitherto 'no go' area of negative gearing. ",49,TimOfAltona
929,"Interesting because as we learned from Scott Morrison yesterday, Chris Bowen had been secretly concocting this 'policy' without the knowledge of Shorten for up to 12 months. Then we discover Bowen's modelling had holes in it - it adversely impacts mum and dad investors attempting to enter the established home property market as well as downward pressure on values of existing investor properties. ",64,TimOfAltona
930,"Never fear though Labor, this afternoon Abbott is sure to cross and uncross his legs and the moment will be captured by a photographer and it will be a headline story by this evening.",34,TimOfAltona
931,Your Labor Party have already tried that confected tactic David and it crashed and burned within days so they dropped it like a hot potato - suggest you do the same or suffer the same fate (crashing and burning).,39,TimOfAltona
932,Your Labor Party have already tried that confected tactic David and it crashed and burned within days so they dropped it like a hot potato - suggest you do the same or suffer the same fate (crashing and burning).,39,TimOfAltona
933,HaHa..only a few days ago the Labor cheer squad were saying bring on a DD to get rid of the government and look how things turn around in a matter of days - suddenly it's all about running away from a DD and making the the government serving out it's full term. ,53,TimOfAltona
934,I love watching the Labor cheer squad get all excited when a poll shows Labor improving - the same polls of course are instantly dismissed as media conspiracies when they show support for Labor or Shorten dropping. LOL. ,39,TimOfAltona
935,"Polls come and go comrades. Did none of you hear the CEO of Roy Morgan Research last night on Q&amp;A (this is the real world now) explain how if an election were held today, the Turnbull government would be comfortably returned?",41,TimOfAltona
936,"As I've said many times , a strong win to Turnbull (and that's looking increasingly likely) at the election will cement his authority and therefore his reform agenda on the party and the government as a whole. ",38,TimOfAltona
937,My view is Australians want to give him that strong win to allow him time to implement reform and give Australia that much needed political stability absent for the past 8 years or so.  ,36,TimOfAltona
938,"Yes, the more Turnbull speaks, the more of what he is saying is resonating with voters - best to try and stop that happening as soon as possible or Labor stand zero chance of winning an election with Turnbull around huh?",41,TimOfAltona
939,"Take a backseat, enjoy the ride for the next three years and work out a way the ALP can better present themselves as an alternative government in 2019. Starts with the leadership.",32,TimOfAltona
940,I know precisely how our legislature works. What we need to change is the situation where some bozo with a handful of senate primary votes somehow gets to be a senator ahead of candidates who received thousands of more primary votes and ends up threatening to block all government bills if he doesn't get his way. ,57,TimOfAltona
941,"Labor are not in government, going by the size of the LNP majority in the lower house, people did not want labor in government - then why should a party with a handful of reps in the lower house have the ability to block a government's ability to govern.",49,TimOfAltona
942,"Voters rightly expect the democratically elected government (ie the government the majority of voters want to govern the nation) to actually govern. When a recalcitrant senate blocks bills thus disallowing the duly elected government to govern, then we have the shambles of the past 2.5 years occurring. ",48,TimOfAltona
943,"Australians are yearning for stable government and a government that actually 'governs' - fixing up the senate will assist with that, whether it be a Liberal or Labor government in office.",31,TimOfAltona
944,Last I looked we elect a government to govern the nation for the following 3 years - it is a ludicrous situation when some bozo attracts a handful of primary votes and works his/her way into the senate via a series of complex preference deals - hardly representative of the people and then goes onto blocking government bills and good governance of the nation. ,65,TimOfAltona
945,The Labor cheer squad would share my opinion on this if it were their party in government and a mishmash of blow ins in the senate were frustrating Labor's ability to actually govern the nation. ,36,TimOfAltona
946,The sooner the voting reform bill goes through and the sooner a DD is called and we can get down to electing a government and senate to actually govern the nation and provide political stability for at least a term - something we haven't seen for the last 8 years.,50,TimOfAltona
947,"Bit difficult with a recalcitrant senate - the sooner the senate voting reforms are passed, the sooner we can see the government duly elected by the people to, well, err.........govern.",30,TimOfAltona
948,Clearly the tussle over senate voting reform indicates Labor have fallen way short of winning the hearts and minds of the electorate and are not expecting to win any federal elections any time soon otherwise why would they want to stand in the way of the ALP both being in government and potentially having control of the senate (in partnership with the Greens) aka known as leftie utopia?,68,TimOfAltona
949,"I thought one of the most interesting comments of the evening came from Michele Levine CEO of Roy Morgan Research - that if an election were held today, Malcolm Turnbull's government would be safely returned. ",36,TimOfAltona
950,"Perhaps a DD is the way to go, clean up the senate so the elected government can actually govern and give Turnbull a further 3 years to implement his reform agenda.",31,TimOfAltona
951,Hey you never know what may happen. I know for a fact West Papua is on his radar and hopefully on his 'to do' list if he is rewarded with another term.  ,34,TimOfAltona
952,"I'm probably the last person you want recommending your comment, but I have. It is a fair and reasonable summary and a refreshing change from most of the partisan tripe posted on this thread. Tonight we saw why Turnbull is probably the leader to effect positive change/reform - he needs a strong win whether it is via a DD or a general election at the end of the year to gather the momentum to achieve that positive social and fiscal change.  ",83,TimOfAltona
953,"In my view the leaders of the two major parties, Shorten and Turnbull are both decent people but there can only be one of them in The Lodge for the next 3 years and by what I saw on Q&amp;A tonight most Australians are backing Turnbull to stay the course and deliver the political stability absent over the past 8 years.  ",63,TimOfAltona
954,"All it achieves is to attract the usual rusted on Labor mob peddling grubby and offensive comments, perhaps to compensate for their own inability to express emotion or just the usual hate filled comments directed at anyone who presents a threat to Labor's chances of winning back government in the next few years. ",54,TimOfAltona
955,Interesting that the little 'engagement' Shorten had with Corey during the presser the other day actually started with Shorten commenting to Bernardi as he walked past in the corridor - then Corey responded and Shorten shot back with the homophobe remark. ,42,TimOfAltona
956,Fortuitously for Labor it was somehow 'lost' under piles of papers on the desk of one Anthony Albanese so did not see the public light of day until the new administration came in.  ,35,TimOfAltona
957,"So...anyone can hop on the GetUp site and start a petition - great, I may hop on and start a ""Let's re-elect Turnbull at the next election"" petition....see how long that one survives.",33,TimOfAltona
958,"A GetUp endorsed candidate, even with the support of the Greens and their Labor partners, winning the highly conservative seat of New England held by the sitting Deputy PM of the nation has about as much chance of getting up as Gough Whitlam has of returning to lead the Labor Party.",51,TimOfAltona
959,They were about to vote him out last election as payback for the disastrous Gillard years. Not too sure the electorate will want the same bloke back who this time is linked to the far left anti-everything activists in GetUp. ,41,TimOfAltona
960,Polling in New England prior to the 2013 election had the Nats at 67% primary vote vs Windsor's 25% - hence you can see why Windsor did the big bail out. ,32,TimOfAltona
961,Any chance you can explain how Windsor would have held his seat in the 2013 election when polling showed the Nationals had a primary vote of 67% to Windsor's 25%? ,31,TimOfAltona
962,"Not too sure New England voters want a GetUp front man representing them, plus he carries enormous baggage from the failed Gillard administration which wasn't all that long ago. ",30,TimOfAltona
963,"All I saw was he was about to be given the royal boot from his seat at the last election as payback for his support for the deeply unpopular, almost reviled Gillard administration. ",34,TimOfAltona
964,GetUp! appear further to the left than the Greens. A key platform encourages opening up of Australian borders and accepting all who want to come to Australia claiming asylum - under GetUp policy Australia would become a magnet for the global people smuggling industry. ,45,TimOfAltona
965,"Well it seems the tables they had booked at the Mauka Subway to celebrate the 20th anniversary to office of this country's second longest serving PM fell through, so they had to book a room at Parliament House at short notice.",41,TimOfAltona
966,Anyone else get the impression from this morning's Insiders that Albo is priming himself to take over the reigns of the ALP immediately after the election? (In the likely event of a coalition victory)  ,36,TimOfAltona
967,"I think we can all agree he will be a much more formidable adversary to take on the Turnbull government next term. His deputy will be interesting...I don't think he'll want to bring Plibersek over, she has not been a strong performer and carries baggage from the failed Gillard/Rudd years, but I guess the usual Labor factional arm wrestles will determine the Deputy. ",64,TimOfAltona
968,"The Labor front bench talent pool sort of drifts away beyond Chris Bowen and perhaps Dreyfus, so in his reshuffle Albo needs to bring in talent like Ed Husic and perhaps the screaming banshee (in QT at least) from the seat of Griffith. ",44,TimOfAltona
969,Conservative governments have a habit of being around for longer periods. The signs are good for Turnbull provided he has a solid win next election and settles into his first full term as Australian PM.,35,TimOfAltona
970,Is it just me or isn't it better to see the policies of the government before passing judgement and deciding who gets your second preferences? Otherwise how can you compare? ,31,TimOfAltona
971,"Nothing more than a mix of Labor propaganda and wishful thinking. Claiming Abbott will do a ""Rudd"" is delusional. Rudd ""stepped in"" because Gillard was about as popular as a liberal MP at a CFMEU bbq.  ",38,TimOfAltona
972,"Turnbull on the other hand enjoys the confidence of the majority of Australian voters as evidenced by both the polls, the bookies and mainstream voters - hardly the climate to replace him as leader.",34,TimOfAltona
973,"There is an element of truth in what you say. That said, a strong win for Turnbull will give him the clear air he needs to implement reform. It's whether Australia wants to delver him that strong win or face the prospect of a 6th PM in almost as many years. ",52,TimOfAltona
974,This piece is a fair and measured observation of things as they stand today and summarises the challenges facing both Shorten and Turnbull along with their respective strengths and weaknesses. ,31,TimOfAltona
975,If you were to do a good old fashioned SWOT analysis on Shorten and Turnbull as who is most likely to win at the next election you would arrive at the conclusion that the election is Turnbull's to lose.  ,41,TimOfAltona
976,"Something fairly catastrophic would need to occur for the LNP to fall short and if you examine things objectively Labor's two biggest threats remain - they simply have too many seats in the lower house to make up and their leader carries exceptionally heavy baggage and a has a constant low popularity rating, hovering around the death zone. ",59,TimOfAltona
977,"Turnbull on the other hand enjoys the complete opposite, a massive majority in the lower house and a popularity rating up in the stratosphere. No wonder the bookies have the LNP as firm favourites with Labor as rank outsiders.",39,TimOfAltona
978,I think the 'Chinese' are a bit smarter than you give them credit for - they will know more about what's going on with Abbott than most which means they will not be linking Abbott with the current Australian government.,40,TimOfAltona
979,"With Gillard voters had no idea why she topped Rudd &amp; with little or no justification given it came back to haunt her, whilst with Turnbull pretty much every man and his dog knew why Abbott was removed with plenty of fanfare and high fives from the left I might add - except the ALP themselves who wanted Abbott to stay PM to help get their lame duck leader over the line.",72,TimOfAltona
980,Won't happen - a strong win by Turnbull will all but see the end of Tony Abbott in the parliament thus snuffing out Labor's hopes of an Abbott return IMO.,30,TimOfAltona
981,"Turnbull is banking on a strong win at the election to consolidate his authority, silence agitators in his own party and give himself a mandate to progress reform along the lines of his stated vision for Australia. ",38,TimOfAltona
982,"Yes, that includes same sex marriage, yes that includes transition to renewables, yes that includes resolving the current impasse over Manus and Nauru ( and shutting them down) and yes that includes fiscal reform to head off the guaranteed global economic turndowns ahead. ",44,TimOfAltona
983,"Your biggest problem is that Shorten is 'famous' for being one of the Labor Party's faceless men who on his way to the leadership role not only stabbed two sitting Labor PM's in the process but was also 'inserted' into the role ahead of the man the majority of the party wanted, Albo. ",54,TimOfAltona
984,People don't forget this and is largely viewed as a union apparatchik parachuted into the role who has since been grilled at a Royal Commission into Trade Union thuggery and also has had his personal past very publicly raked over. ,41,TimOfAltona
985,I maintain for these reasons he is all but unelectable and his polling reflects that fact. I seriously doubt anyone listens to him anymore - you only need looks at some of the First Dog on The Moon cartoons to gauge what people are really thinking about him and it isn't great.,52,TimOfAltona
986,Here's the thing - you and pretty much everyone else in this thread have already passed judgement on government policies before they have even been released and irrespective of the merits will wholeheartedly condemn them. ,36,TimOfAltona
987,Was not suggesting she did. Lenore has been critical of the government and of Turnbull's apparent inaction for some time now. This column is her summation of where she believes the state of play is now based on Lenore being close to the action. ,45,TimOfAltona

989,"You only see and hear what you want to because it suits your political agenda yet there is a whole other world out there with a very different point of view, some call it main stream Australia. ",38,TimOfAltona
990,Since then we have seen next to nothing occur. My theory is Shorten 'shelved' party reform when he believed Abbott was going to hand him the prime ministership - all he had to do was 'be there' for the election and nature would take it's course. ,47,TimOfAltona
991,"Now with Turnbull's arrival he's been caught short, no pun intended, and doing his darnedest to try and build a negative story around the man most Australians want to see as PM.",32,TimOfAltona

997,Labor are incredibly sensitive to voters perceptions that they are soft when it comes to national security and border security - hence there was bi-partisan support for Abbott's Stop the Boats policy.,32,TimOfAltona
998,"The Guardian's exposure, in Australia at least, lies in it allowing it's political content and CIF to be hijacked by the often extreme Labor/Greens left wing mob who by and large do not represent the views of mainstream Australians.  ",41,TimOfAltona
999,In the UK and US editions I see the political commentary and CIF participation is more balanced in nature with better representation of views and contributions from both the left and right. Not so in Australia where it risks being seen nothing more than a left wing mouthpiece along with the associated irrelevancy.,53,TimOfAltona
1000,Who can forget Bill camping out in supermarket aisles for days waiving around wet lettuce leaves and announcing the sky was falling because this 'evil' government included GST in a tax reform review. ,34,TimOfAltona
1001,He just fell short of proclaiming Armageddon was about to hit but ultimately made a complete fool of himself in the media who saw through his GST scare tactics and reported as such.,33,TimOfAltona
1002,He had a great win in that last question. Made Labor look stupid after that interjection from Dreyfus. Notice how the entire Labor front bench stared down at the floor it was so embarrassing for them.,36,TimOfAltona

1005,Just having a bit of fun with the teal ties. Main point was that part of the reason Labor's vote has collapsed is due to Shorten's penchant for copying government policy on contentious issues such as border protection/refugees and data retention. It's all political opportunism and not core Labor values.,50,TimOfAltona
1006,"I've heard they are useful for keeping merchant shipping lanes secure, but since the end of WWII have not seen much evidence of Australia's shipping lanes under threat from enemy subs?",31,TimOfAltona
1007,Can't see why Australia needs 12 submarines. What useful and practical purpose do the billions they cost to manufacture and operate deliver for the country? The existing 6 sit dormant at docks a lot of the time because the navy can't attract enough submariners to crew them (a very different skill/training set from crewing surface vessels) so crewing 12 sounds like a lost cause. ,65,TimOfAltona
1008,Labelling people 'morons' who exercise their democratic rights and hold an opinion contrary to your own is not the best way to get your Labor party in to government. In fact it reflects on the Labor party overall and is not a good look in an election year IMO.,49,TimOfAltona
1009,"We are all familiar with Bingle Bill's penchant for copying government policies in keys areas, but today is bizarre. Sending out his spies to check on what tie the PM is wearing so he can emulate is taking the me-tooism a little too far.",44,TimOfAltona
1010,Perhaps you are confused on the difference between new properties and existing properties. Under Labor's proposal the demand and therefore cost of the former goes up and the market valuation of the latter goes down. Fairly simple economics.,38,TimOfAltona
1011,"The defence white paper will be interesting. Labor's quandary is they have to find a way to attack it without being seen to be soft on the nations defence. It's no secret our defence forces do not receive the same level of funding when Labor governments are in power, in fact they tend to slash defence spending , so it will be interesting to see how Labor play this one. ",71,TimOfAltona
1012,"O'Dwyer was spot on. Under Labor's rushed negative gearing policy new property pricing will increase due to higher demand, whilst existing home owners will see a reduction in their property value.",31,TimOfAltona
1013,Perhaps the Turnbull hyperbole was a little too strong but when you consider Shorten's efforts with waiving wet lettuce leaves and scaring young children around supermarket aisles over the GST faux scare mongering I don't think Turnbull's effort in QT today was anywhere close. ,45,TimOfAltona
1014,Why does one get the impression that had the Turnbull government proposed Labor's negative gearing changes Shorten would be on his ideology soapbox accusing the government of bashing mum and dad investors and trashing house prices? ,37,TimOfAltona
1015,He has one shot at becoming PM and he knows he's the least preferred of all the political leaders (hell even Abbott had a higher popularity rating than Bingle) so it's do or die time for him. ,38,TimOfAltona
1016,Don't discount Labor doing another Hawke at the last moment - or perhaps a better comparison is doing another Rudd - Albo coming in to save some Labor furniture at the election.,32,TimOfAltona

1018,"How much time have you donated to go down to the Wayside Chapel and help out the homeless and destitute? I don't mean once or twice, I mean on a regular basis for the past 20 years or so. If you don't know what it's like to do that, ask the PM. ",53,TimOfAltona
1019,"If you ever want to see the PM in person, head on down to the Wayside in Darlinghurst this Christmas Day, you'll see Malcolm and Lucy setting up tables, serving up food and chatting to people struggling with life as a result of domestic violence, drug or alcohol addiction, mental illness and the like. ",55,TimOfAltona
1020,Weak attempts such as yours to portray Turnbull as some kind of wealthy elitist individual falls flat on its face time and time again. Even your beloved ALP tried hat fake tactic and ran away from it very quickly. Suggest you follow suit.,43,TimOfAltona

1023,The question remains - will Labor and the Greens kiss and make up or will the Greens start bed hopping as they realise Labor are definitely not the conjugal partner they thought they were. ,35,TimOfAltona
1024,It is for the millions who took out high mortgages on properties only to have their value eroded on Labor's desperate attempt to create faux differentiation from the Libs. ,30,TimOfAltona

1028,Whether they formally adopted her or not is not the point of the story. It was their totally selfless act of human kindness and compassion towards an unidentified dead and abandoned baby girl that is the point. They 'adopted' her to give her a respectful and dignified funeral. ,49,TimOfAltona
1029,You only have to look at the individual story around each of the recent Labor MP bailouts to see that barefaced factionalism is rife within the ALP and look no further than the Labor make up in the senate to see it is nothing more than a factional 'reward' gig for worn out union hacks towing the party line and sucking off the public teat before retirement. ,68,TimOfAltona
1030,"Right here is one of the key reasons the ALP are struggling for relevance and struggling in the polls, they promised party reform following the nightmare of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd period which resulted in the ALP becoming a rump of their former self in the lower house, yet they go ahead and place a key factional 'faceless man' player in as their leader against the overwhelming wishes of their membership to insert Albo. ",73,TimOfAltona
1031,Labor will never get ahead and never feel the warmth of the green leather seats on the government side of the house again until they ditch Shorten and implement much needed party reform which reduces the power of the Union factions over the party and also come up with a way to win government without having to rely on deals with the Greens to get them over the line. Both are electorally toxic.,73,TimOfAltona
1032,Whilst the lefties keep labelling the processing centres thus they get little or no sympathy from mainstream Australia and will always remain on the fringes of the debate. They are not concentration camps in the sense you erroneously claim them to be. Get real.,44,TimOfAltona

1034,The weakness in your argument is that Labor have done nothing to earn back the trust of voters. They promised party reform and nothing has happened. Their leader is about the most unpopular politician in the country and Labor MP's have been bailing out left right and centre over the past couple of weeks. Not a good look for a party hoping to present as a viable alternative government.,69,TimOfAltona
1035,"The LNP have a massive seat majority in the lower house, I doubt even the most ardent Labor supporters such as yourself realistically believe Labor can overtake the government in an election any time soon, particularly with a leader who hovers around 14% in the preferred PM stakes vs 65% odd for Turnbull. ",54,TimOfAltona
1036,It's clear Shorten and the ALP are in a weak position currently and I don't think the LNP will have too much trouble getting comfortably over the line if an election were held soon. ,35,TimOfAltona

1040,Australia's contribution to 'plasticising' the oceans and waterways is miniscule compared to other parts of the world. Australia as a developed nation is not a contributor to large scale plastic pollution in the ocean. ,35,TimOfAltona

1044,"Turnbull is pragmatic and knows it won't get up without the Labor states also backing it. Whilst the Labor premiers would dearly love to see the GST rise to 15%, they had to tow the party line because Shorted thought he had to fight an federal election over the issue. ",51,TimOfAltona
1045," As Labor have mirrored the government policies in other key areas, particularly border protection and electronic surveillance he needs to put up a risky policy initiative which he hopes will resonate with voters who have largely deserted the ALP for the Greens, Independents and LNP.

1053,News flash Sam - the vast majority of 16 and 17 years olds are not tuned into politics and if pushed to do so would probably vote according to the popularity of the party leader. ,36,TimOfAltona
1054,"This means if that age group voted at the next election, Liberal candidates would enjoy a surge in votes due to Malcolm Turnbull and Labor candidates would all but miss out due to Bingle Bill. Not many 16 &amp; 17 yr olds know who Richard DiNatale is so there goes the Green vote. ",54,TimOfAltona
1055,Open up voting eligibility for 16 and 17 yr olds but not make it compulsory until they reach 18 years. That way those in the age group with an interest in politics can have their say and the rest can wait until 18.  ,45,TimOfAltona
1056,The same reason both the government and the Labor opposition have told us time and time again - it removes the people smugglers deadly business model - you know - the one that resulted in over 1000+ people perishing at sea.,41,TimOfAltona
1057,"Valid points you raise. Corruption within the Indonesian police, military and local government officials allow the people smugglers to operate with impunity and in plain sight. That is  they have a product to sell and business aint very good for them since the current government came into office.",49,TimOfAltona
1058,Answer the question Daisy. Nice piece of avoidance there.The people getting into people smuggler boats in Turkey trying to get to Greece are not the ones heading to Australia. They are trying to reach Germany. Although that avenue seems a little difficult now. I drove through one of the Austrian/Germany border crossings early last week and the German police had road blocks up were stopping and searching any vehicle that could be carrying migrants - not sure what they were doing with any migrants they located but it looks like Germany has toughened up on it's original 'all comers welcome' position.,101,TimOfAltona

1067,"Look no further than the ALP to see how corrosive a 'forced' leadership change can be to a sitting government. Labor all but devoured itself in the fallout from the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years and are still trying, albeit at a snails pace, to recover...but that's another story. ",47,TimOfAltona
1068,A strong election win and a Prime Ministership in his own right should see Turnbull's transitioning of the LNP back towards the electorally popular centre a whole lot easier - many say territory Labor under Shorten has abandoned in it's quest to keep up with the Abbott administration. ,49,TimOfAltona
1069,I'm with you. There is probably plenty of other material to use rather than the Johnny Depp incident - most Australians would have backed Barnaby's comments over the two dogs being smuggled in by Depp'sentourage.,35,TimOfAltona

1076,Tells us this - can you point to where a Leader of a major political party who sits on a popularity rating of around 14-15% goes on to lead his party to victory at a looming federal election? ,39,TimOfAltona

1078,"We remember well how they thought they could get the public behind them by attacking Turnbull's wealth and personal success in life - it went down like a lead balloon out in voter land, Turnbull's popularity increased and they dropped it faster than you can say 'Cayman Islands.' ",49,TimOfAltona
1079,"Bottom line is Stuart Robert's trip to China makes not one iota of difference to the next election result. Apart from a few die hard Labor supporters who will still vote ALP if a three day old cheese sandwich were to replace Bingle Bill as leader, no one gives a toss about Stuart Roberts road trip to China.  ",60,TimOfAltona
1080,"Labor have a terrible image problem which they can't shake off whilst Shorten is leader, so spinning their wheels over Stuart Robert ain't going to deliver them government.

1084,Labor can only stand by and weep as the Turnbull government occupies territory Labor abandoned in their quest to mirror the Abbott government's policies on everything from border protection to data retention laws.,33,TimOfAltona
1085,"At this point in time in Australia's political history, right here is Labor's problem.

1094,Labor's problem was in the execution - Bingle Bill waiving around lettuce leafs in highly staged supermarket visits meant it was doomed from the start and just like their hapless Cayman Island tactic it fell flat on it's face before it had hardly begun.,44,TimOfAltona

These things won't change overnight but as far as I see the groundwork is being put in place to enact change. ",61,TimOfAltona

1129,"There is huge difference here - previously the LNP were bound by the party line on this issue as were the ALP. Providing the national plebiscite is in the affirmative, MPs can all vote according to their conscience or if they choose, what their constituents want (they are after all only in parliament because their constituents placed them there to represent them). Providing enough Labor and LNP MP's vote in the affirmative it will go to the senate where the same rules apply. ",84,TimOfAltona

1134,"If the outcome of the plebiscite is in the affirmative, the parliament will have a vote. The LNP will need to allow a conscience vote, as will Labor, which is not something that has been permitted before on this issue. ",41,TimOfAltona
1135,"Providing Australians vote in the affirmative in the plebiscite you then need to go back to the individual views held by MPs in both houses , and given the high LNP numbers in the lower house particularly, you need to hope that more Liberal MPs support the bill if it is to have any chance of success. ",58,TimOfAltona
1136,Labor agitators in this thread are correct about one thing....Turnbull metaphorically speaking still has his Prime Ministerial training wheels on and yes because he's new has to tread carefully around a few issues at odds with the small and potentially dangerous Abbott clique in his government. ,47,TimOfAltona
1137,In my opinion that will dissipate in the event he has a strong victory in the election this year. A strong win is needed to silence any internal critics Turnbull may have. ,33,TimOfAltona
1138,"He will have considerably more authority to implement reform within his party and take the next LNP government on that road to the popular centre, possibly even occupy the ground Shorten and Labor vacated in their haste to copy the Abbott government way off to the right. ",48,TimOfAltona
1139,This will be a thrilling couple of years in Australian politics and you can't help get the feeling Turnbull presents as a moderate long term PM taking the whole country with him. The polls so far indicate that is the case. ,42,TimOfAltona
1140,"Labor have no alternative but to initiate full and thorough reform and rebuild to try and win back a heartland that is rapidly abandoning them for the Greens, the Libs or Independents.

1146,I'm with you. I vote we all just live miserable lives and hating who we are and what we stand for as a nation. No one in this country deserves recognition for anything so let's get rid of Australian of the Year awards completely.,44,TimOfAltona

1148,Explain to us again how Rosie Batty is an example of a Liberal government (under Tony Abbott to boot) using Australian of the Year to show off the military?? ,30,TimOfAltona

1154,If I were a Labor/Greens supporter I wouldn't be focussing all my energy on Tony Abbott in the hope he may be able to save Labor from the looming defeat at the polls - I'd be more interested in how to transform the Labor Party into a viable alternative government - starting with sorting out a deeply unpopular and inept leader who has about as much charisma as those wet lettuce leaves he was waving around in a supermarket the other day.,82,TimOfAltona
1155,General consensus is it's the one area he succeeded in. He sorted out the almighty mess Labor left behind after they totally lost control of Australia's borders by allowing the people smugglers to dictate Australia's immigration arrivals. ,38,TimOfAltona
1156,I doubt the 'rest of the world' even know who Rudd or Abbott are...if anything Rudd may be identified as the PM who kick started the Indonesian maritime people smuggler industry with tens of thousands of people incarcerated and 1000+ deaths at sea and Abbott may be identified as the Australian PM who stopped all that happening - apart from that they would be relatively unknown.,66,TimOfAltona

1159,I have locked away some gems from the past few days ready to roll them out after the election result. So much nonsense has been sprouted recently (usually after another poll showing Shorten &amp; Labor are all but finished) it's difficult to differentiate between what is genuinely held beliefs and just outright leftist propaganda. ,55,TimOfAltona
1160,Exactly what happened in NZ and then the current PM John Key went to an election with a 15% and cruised home to victory against the NZ Labour Party. ,30,TimOfAltona

1163,It'll be interesting to see if the Labor tactics squad in their desperation try and resort to this message as the election gets closer - a vote for Turnbull is a vote for Abbott. Nothing like a good old Labor confected scare campaign.,43,TimOfAltona
1164,Even the ALP strategists can see that they have little prospect of a win next election if Turnbull remains leader of the Libs. If they can see it so can the rest of Australia.,34,TimOfAltona
1165,"Looks like they are stuck with him until the next election, after which he will stand aside 'for the good of the party'. The BIG question is who will they find to replace him?",34,TimOfAltona
1166,The good old media conspiracy theories abound when Labor are seemingly on the ropes. Ever considered there may be other reasons why the polling is what it is - like Shorten is genuinely not liked or trusted by the majority of voters?,42,TimOfAltona
1167,Shorten &amp;Labor back the government's offshore processing policy - in fact it was the ALP who opened these places and sent thousands of men women and children to them. So I suspect your comment about a different polling outcome is not necessarily correct.,43,TimOfAltona
1168,Labor's current dilemma stems from the fact that they have never recovered from the Rudd/Gillard civil wars. Reform was promised but next to nothing has happened - voters can see that. ,32,TimOfAltona
1169,In addition the factions inserted a bloke who many say was the architect of the aforementioned civil wars and he carries so much negative baggage from all that no one likes him or trusts him - voters can see that ,41,TimOfAltona
1170,"In addition Labor are influenced too much by the unions and their power brokers and not only are unions not particularly held in high regard given all the dramas surrounding them in recent years, they only represent a tiny portion of the Australian workforce - voters can see that ",50,TimOfAltona
1171,In addition Labor have not resolved their association/affiliation with the Greens. This is a negative. People clearly recall Bob Brown and Julia Gillard fawning over each other in their new found love in which everyone interpreted as Bob Brown installing himself as the defacto Deputy PM. The Greens are seen as a party of activists by mainstream Australia and Labor need to think seriously about standing on their own two feet to win an election instead of cuddling up to the Greens on preferences - Voters can see that. ,90,TimOfAltona
1172,"In addition, people don't know what Labor stand for anymore. They have abandoned their traditional turf and under Shorten have moved over to the grass traditionally occupied by a moderate Liberal Party. Their biggest threat now is that Turnbull brings his party back to that turf and they have no where to go. They are caught in no mans land and irrelevancy- voters can see that.",66,TimOfAltona
1173,My interest is in who will replace Bill when he stands down. I reckon very discreet jockeying in the factions has already begun and there will be an almighty shit fight between the left and right. It's fascinating stuff. ,40,TimOfAltona
1174,"Personally my gut feel is they will opt for the favourite Albo believing he is the only one who can take the fight up to a Turnbull lead government, but in reality can you REALLY see Albo as PM material? Huge question marks over that.",45,TimOfAltona

1176,Not for me to defend the Guardian but in fairness it's true to say they are pretty quick off the mark when the government stuff up or a minister makes a controversial comment etc. I think it's referred to as 'Holding them to account' ,45,TimOfAltona
1177,"Keep that up sunshine, burying your head in the sand and pretending all is rosy down at team Labor is called delusion and is sure to keep them out of government for a very long time.",36,TimOfAltona
1178,It is the extent of that win that will determine Turnbull's ultimate authority and therefore mandate to continue his push to return the Libs back towards the popular centre. ,30,TimOfAltona
1179,"I want to hear from Finnigans - we need our daily dose of ""It's all over for this Turnbull/LNP/News Ltd government"" and ""Shorten and Labor will win in a landslide victory"" and my personal favourite from Chippendale - ""Australian's are queuing up in their millions with baseball bats to rid this country of Malcolm Turnbull and his government"".

1180,If parents with children are afforded passage to Australia then the people smugglers have a business model they can work with and the boats laden with families will start departing Indonesia once more with the hope/expectation the children are the passport to bypass the UNHCR queues and get into Australia by boat. ,53,TimOfAltona
1181,This is a good thing. Having said that the sooner the facilities are closed down permanently on Nauru the better. The Howard administration achieved that before the Labor government got them up and running again when they lost control of the borders after Rudd gave the people smugglers their business model back. ,53,TimOfAltona
1182,"As far as you can see, the current government are working to reducing the number of children in immigration detention with a fair bit of success thus far and eventually the centres will be shut down - for good. ",40,TimOfAltona

1184,"Multiple contractor reports stating that there was cause to suspect that STC staff were engaging in 'coaching' asylum seekers to protest self harm were making their way to the minister's office.

In the meantime the contractors deemed the STC staff were a risk to the good management of the facility with a recommendation they be removed whilst the inquiry and report were under way. ",82,TimOfAltona
1185,Morrison has not been Immigration Minister for some time now and it's up to the current minister to respond if he chooses - this falls squarely in his area of responsibility.  ,33,TimOfAltona

",57,TimOfAltona
1191,"David, I think it safe to bet my house on the fact that you agree with Tim Wilson's comments as well. Be a little bit weird if you didn't. ",30,TimOfAltona
1192,"Given that Morrison was not actually living and working in Nauru himself to witness what was occurring, it's a fair bet he was relying on reports from others on the ground. It's not the first time a Minister has been provided erroneous information and in this case it came from multiple sources. ",53,TimOfAltona

1231,Easy to see why he has your lot worried. Shorten on the ropes with little prospect of a recovery any time soon. Labor should not have just sat back expecting Abbott to hand over the keys to The Lodge - Turnbull has caught the ALP flat-footed and they will pay the ultimate price - a very long stint on the opposition benches.,62,TimOfAltona

1345,Turnbull's decision to promote Brough has probably more to do with the fact Brough agreed to support Turnbull against Abbott. In the heat of the moment when the golden chalice is within reach such agreements occur. ,37,TimOfAltona
1346,But the polls show the exact opposite to what you are saying - no one is waiting to toss out the government except a handful of bitter and twisted Labor supporters who still haven't recovered from the drubbing they received at the 2013 election.,44,TimOfAltona
1347,They had already started...all attacking him for not visiting the bushfire areas and when he does tour the area...you guessed it....it's nothing more than a photo opportunity according to the Labor cheer squad.,33,TimOfAltona
1348,We all remember the ugly spectacle of Gillard defending Craig Thomson when the whole world knew he had plenty to hide. Made her look shifty and not to be trusted.,30,TimOfAltona
1349,"Reality is that whether Briggs is on the front bench or the back bench changes nothing for Labor - they are still up shit creek with Shorten paddling as fast as his little arms will allow. Only a matter of time before the canoe hits the rocks, roughly around the time of the next election at a good guess. ",60,TimOfAltona
1350,The Labor cheer squad have precious little to crow about these days as their side catapults further into political obscurity - give them their 5 minutes of compensatory 'fun' before the reality sets in again.,35,TimOfAltona
1351,"So out of touch he has a popularity rating up in the stratosphere, whilst the bloke you want as PM is down in the gutter if not heading for the sewer as we speak. ",35,TimOfAltona
1352,Not sure the Guardian is doing itself any favors by printing what is clearly propaganda from a left wing commentator - for balance they should allow either Scott Morrison or Annabel Crabb to defend themselves against these allegations with a response piece? ,43,TimOfAltona
1353,Morrison is after all a member of a government the majority of Australians voted for and still consider the best option to govern Australia (according to all the polls since Turnbull was elected leader).,34,TimOfAltona
1354,"The left don't like him because he delivered on a policy that the Libs took to an election, won convincingly vs an inept ALP, and stopped the boats which saved perhaps thousands of lives.  ",36,TimOfAltona
1355,"This showed up Labor's total ineptitude when it came to border protection as is perhaps one of the reasons they will stay in opposition for quite a few years to come IMO,",32,TimOfAltona
1356,You see it dozens of times a day in Guardian threads. How many in this thread only 'enjoy' Kitchen Cabinet when it has a Labor or Greens politician as guest and see nothing more than right-wing propaganda when a Liberal pollie is on. ,44,TimOfAltona
1357,"Same with opinion polls. When they show Labor in front the polls are 'a true and honest reflection of voters intentions' but as soon as they show the government ahead, they are deemed nothing more than a Murdoch conspiracy and should be instantly dismissed as bogus. ",47,TimOfAltona
1358,The Labor cheer squad want to believe Abbott is on the path to return so it gives them some kind of (forlorn) hope that by some miracle Shorten can fall over the line at an election. ,37,TimOfAltona
1359,I have all the facts before me - the unions pushed and pushed for wage increases that ultimately forced the car manufactures to move off shore to more cost effective labour markets in order to remain globally competitive. ,39,TimOfAltona
1360,"So the unions and their political arm, the ALP, have already all but destroyed the manufacturing industry in Australia, noticeable the car industry, and now here we have the hapless Plibersek being scripted by the ACTU to try and destroy small business operators in Australia. ",46,TimOfAltona
1361,I'm with you. That good old magical money tree growing out the back of Trades Hall the ALP use when in government to keep Australia ticking has served us well for many years . ,35,TimOfAltona
1362, Perhaps it's time Labor let the government borrow the keys so they too can nip around the back and help themselves to the endless cash the magic tree produces so they won't need to consider tax reform or any fiscal reform to safeguard Australia's economy for the future full stop. ,52,TimOfAltona
1363,Which I suspect is the issue the Labor cheer squad have - he stands in the way of Labor being in the political wilderness for years and being in government. ,31,TimOfAltona
1364,Once again the Labor cheer squad have come in half cocked with only part of the story and believing what they want to believe because it suits their agenda. ,30,TimOfAltona
1365,Let's get the full story first as to why this fellow's family was initially refused a visa. The Dept of Immigration work to strict guidelines and policies - there will be a reason why this family were denied a visa and confidentiality requires the Dept to keep those facts confidential. ,51,TimOfAltona
1366,It may or may not come to light down the track but in the meantime it seems these people are now permitted to enter Australia temporarily to see their family member. ,32,TimOfAltona
1367,We have strict border protection rules and regulations for a valid reason and the Immigration Dept should be congratulated for adhering to those rules until the full facts were ascertained/confirmed.,30,TimOfAltona
1368,So bring on an election by all means and let Turnbull get the mandate he needs to continue moving the government to the popular centre ( where Labor used to call home).,32,TimOfAltona
1369,They would be better served by launching their much needed reform to reduce the power of the unions over the ALP and their habitual reliance on the Greens to try and get them over the line at federal and state elections. ,42,TimOfAltona
1370,"Everyone seems hell bent on attacking Greg Hunt for his decision, but not one of the Labor/Greens cheer squad make mention of the fact that he is going on the recommendations form the Labor state government who back the terminal. ",41,TimOfAltona
1371,"Some may dismiss this, but not out of the question he could end up with a portfolio which plays to his strengths in the new Turnbull government after the next election.  ",33,TimOfAltona
1372,Fair to say the government could fund and find a cure for 100% of breast cancers and the Labor/Greens cheer squad would be in this thread saying it's nothing more than chasing votes. ,34,TimOfAltona
1373,To all the Labor cheer squadders hoping and praying Abbott will make a return to the Lib leadership so Labor have a bit of a sporting chance at getting over the line next year I'm here to tell you it just ain't going to happen. ,46,TimOfAltona
1374,"As much as an Abbott return is the stuff your wet dreams are made of, Turnbull's popularity and Shorten languishing at the other end of the scale means an LNP victory is almost in the bag and will allow Turnbull to make further reforms taking the government into territory Labor once called home. ",54,TimOfAltona
1375,"Many things in life are certain and just like death and taxes, we will never ever get to see Bill Shorten flying up to Japan to meet with Shinzo Abe. ",31,TimOfAltona
1376,"I'm with you, we only want to read articles that attack the government and better yet, propose that Shorten will romp it in as next Pm. Made up is fine. ",31,TimOfAltona
1377,"...and without those companies operating, perhaps millions would have no job and no way of supporting themselves or their families...you see comrade sometimes you just need to take the good with the bad. ",34,TimOfAltona
1378,Yep I wish she had stayed on too. Labor would have 25 seats in the lower house vs the 55 odd they have today due to Rudd's and Shorten's intervention to get rid of her.,35,TimOfAltona
1379,"The relationship took somewhat of a hammering recently with the cracking piece about the hapless Bingle Bill, but there is enough scoffing at PM Turnbull in here to gird/engorge the flaccid and dejected loins and rekindle the relationship. ",39,TimOfAltona
1380,"That said, I think we all know the constraints Turnbull, as communications minister was under at the time. His brief from Abbott et al was clear - firstly identify the mismanagement of the roll out under Labor. Albo had done a sterling job in hiding Labor's botched roll out and cost blowouts (was never able to lay his hands on that damn report lost somewhere on his desk) just before the election and then cut the costs as best he could without consigning the remainder of the project to the scrapheap. ",92,TimOfAltona
1381,All in all not a bad effort/compromise which has never satisfied the rabid left who blindly maintain Labor's model was superior whilst blissfully ignoring the billions in extra funding and the decades longer it would take to complete. ,39,TimOfAltona
1382,"That all said - the solution to all this is right before our very eyes...scrap the bloody submarine contracts and hey presto we suddenly have billions of dollars to invest in Australia's future technology capability, including the NBN rollout. ",40,TimOfAltona
1383,"That's the problem, the ALP tended to disguise the true extent of the dilemma to try and win political points - who can forget Swanny standing up announcing all the budget surpluses he was going to deliver Australia? ",39,TimOfAltona
1384,"Well we have all witnessed what happens when the reverse applies - whole manufacturing industries are shipped off shore to lower labour cost nations - like car manufacturing to India, Thailand and China. ",34,TimOfAltona
1385,Putting a price on saving perhaps 1000+ lives is a difficult task. You claim Australia is paying too much to save all these lives so what is your preference - just let people drown at sea? ,37,TimOfAltona
1386,I think it's best we wait until economists pass their considered judgement (&amp; I don't mean that old ALP warhorse Stephen Koukoulas) rather than read the very predictable rants from the Labor cheer squad who would vote for a cheese sandwich if it were ALP leader. ,47,TimOfAltona
1387,There is an element of credibility in this update which both sides of politics would have difficulty in grappling given the deteriorating iron ore price and global economic outlook. ,30,TimOfAltona
1388,Ultimately I don't think that this economic prognosis will do the govt any harm at all given Labor were not exactly economic giants when they had a go in government - in fact the reverse applies and we won't forget Swanny standing up beside a smirking Gillard promising us budget surpluses for the next 20 years under Labor. ,59,TimOfAltona
1389,I seem to recall Labor's greatest contribution to Budget forecasts was Swanny proclaiming with great glee in parliament how Labor were about deliver surpluses for that year and every year after that. ,33,TimOfAltona
1390,"You just happen to not like Turnbull's sermons because he is not from your side of politics. The majority of Australians' however are very happy with Turnbull, going by all the polls and the bookies. Even the Labor strategists must be secretly conceding the next election is all but over. They need to be planning for 2019 and who will be leading the Labor party to that election.",68,TimOfAltona
1391,He can hardly help it when it seems going by every poll that he is the man the majority of Australia want by a country mile as the PM. ,30,TimOfAltona
1392,"If his win next year is resounding, which is looking that way, it will increase his ability and authority to take the LNP government closer to the popular centre and consolidate the LNP as a long term government for Australia - something voters have been crying out for since the Howard years. ",53,TimOfAltona
1393,"Funny thing, opinion polls (you know those funny old things you swear by when they show Labor in front and denounce as propaganda when it shows the Libs in front) they all show quite the opposite to what you are claiming.",41,TimOfAltona
1394,"Labor's magical mystery money tree growing out the back of trades hall is barren, so even Labor would be putting up cuts if they were in government...which they are not...thank god.",31,TimOfAltona
1395,"The Libs now have a leader that people ( apart from the rusted on Labor cheer squad who would vote for a 3 day old ham, cheese and tomato sandwich if it were ALP leader) actually like to see as PM and competently representing Australia on both the domestic and world stage. ",53,TimOfAltona
1396,This equates to an LNP federal government for quite a few years to come whilst Labor sort out their pretend 'unity' that no one buys as much as a leader that no-one (including his own party) buys either.,38,TimOfAltona
1397,"At the end of the day, Labor have done little to demonstrate their ability or even willingness to learn from the toxic mistakes of the highly unpopular Rudd/Gillard/Rudd debacle. ",30,TimOfAltona
1398,You only have to look at the deeply contrasting polls between Turnbull and Shorten to see who will steamroll into government after the next election and who will fall flat on their (faceless) face. ,35,TimOfAltona
1399,Posting grubby and demeaning comments about Julie Bishop will not win the ALP government next year - or the year after or the year after that or ever for that matter. ,32,TimOfAltona
1400,This is no different to mass murderers such as Martin Bryant and Julian Knight being kept in indefinite detention beyond their original sentence if they are deemed to be an unacceptable risk to the community. ,36,TimOfAltona
1401,The cheer squad for Labor and the Greens denouncing this decision designed to A) Make this country safer from those with a proven intent to kill Australians and B) Deter those who have ambitions to kill Australians in Australia by engaging in terrorist activities. ,45,TimOfAltona
1402,I suspect everyone has stopped listening to anything he may be scripted to say from here on in...more interest in guessing who will replace him as leader of the ALP.,30,TimOfAltona
1403,You can only presume they will move on him after the next election. Risky strategy though cos the way it's going Labor may well lose even more seats in the Lower House with Bingle as leader. ,37,TimOfAltona
1404,I think you may have missed the fact that that tactic fell flat on it's face for Labor strategists - they dropped it like a hot potato - suggest you follow suit.,32,TimOfAltona
1405,"My take on what I saw at Cronulla that day, I was there and witnessed perhaps some of the worst of it, it was more to do with too much booze being consumed on a hot day by a bunch of guys too young to know better.  ",49,TimOfAltona
1406,There were a couple of older stirrers draped in Australian flags (clearly pissed) with megaphones geeing up the younger ones and most of the trouble makers were kids in their teens carried away by too much alcohol and the more they drank the louder it got as more and more joined in. ,53,TimOfAltona
1407,"Yes, what they were doing was wrong - but what started as a kind of carnival type atmosphere in the morning soon developed into out of control mobs fuelled by alcohol, mainly made up of no more than high school kids walking around with 24 packs of stubbies under their arms and few older ones who should have known better. ",61,TimOfAltona
1408,"There is no question in my mind that if it were not for the alcohol, the day would have ended up very differently and most of the younger ones, who made up the majority of the crowd, would never have participated and the subsequent alcohol fuelled rampaging violence directed at anyone with Middle Eastern appearance on the beach, the trains, the fast food restaurants or in the park would never have happened.",72,TimOfAltona
1409,I personally don't view Q&amp;A as having a particularly left wing leaning..although the review summarised correctly that the majority of overseas guests tend to be from the progressive side of politics. ,32,TimOfAltona
1410,"I would like to see more shows with only 2 guests - a senior minister from the government with his/her shadow equivalent. We could get some really good meaty debate around policies happening and give both sides an opportunity to showcase their respective arguments...and yes, in fairness the Greens should probably get a look in on the panel too...if only to demonstrate not much separate the Greens and Labor.",69,TimOfAltona
1411,"Likewise Shorten should stop commenting on Abbott's comments. No doubt he thinks he's getting some kind of political mileage out of reminding people that Abbott used to be PM, but ultimately despite Abbott's shortcomings, his approval rating was always higher than Bill's. ",43,TimOfAltona
1412,"I suspect The Guardian have achieved their objective - you only need to have the words 'Tony' and 'Abbott' in the headline, no matter how inane the story and the Labor/Greens cheer squad all flood into the thread to submit their usual anti-Abbott confected rhetoric. ",46,TimOfAltona
1413,"Kristina, fair to say no matter what becomes of Brough, stay whether he stays, goes or nothing changes it at all makes zero difference to the final outcome of the next federal election. ",34,TimOfAltona
1414,We all know Labor are up against it at the next election and if they don't discard Shorten probably the one after that too..let's see Labor at least attempt to initiate the promised reform instead if pretending it is no longer needed - until they do they can expect to wither on the opposition benches for years to come.,59,TimOfAltona
1415,"Abbott could have turfed him out in 2013, given Washington is regarded as the second highest diplomatic posting after the UK and usually reserved for party apparatchiks, at least Abbott did the right thing by leaving Kim in Washington. ",40,TimOfAltona
1416,They are neither gulags or concentration camps - go back and look up the history books to see what happened in both those places - no resemblance whatsoever to either Manus or Nauru. ,34,TimOfAltona
1417,"On Nauru for instance, no one is 'locked up' - everyone can come and go from the facility as much as they like and free to roam outside at their leisure. ",32,TimOfAltona
1418,Of course nobody wants to see people held on Manus or Nauru - the sooner they are emptied and closed down the better - just like back in the Howard Government days before Labor opened up the flood gates and reopened the offshore centres after losing control of our borders. ,51,TimOfAltona
1419,"If FD can suggest a way we can release these people (who choose to stay in Manus or Nauru above relocating to another country on offer not Australia) without restarting the last Labor initiated debacle of tens of thousands attempting to reach Australia on hundreds of people smuggling boats accompanied by the inevitable tragic mass drownings along the way, then we are all ears.",64,TimOfAltona
1420,"I'm with you, we only want media outlets and publications to spread the word on how great life is under a Labor/Greens government - anything else is just toilet paper and should be dismissed as trash journalism.",37,TimOfAltona
1421,I want to know what India is doing - far more relevant to the topic of global warming than anything Australia will ever need to do or indeed achieve in a hundred years. ,34,TimOfAltona
1422,A person no one wants as ALP leader let alone PM of this country (see latest FDOTM cartoon) and a party that promised reform and rebuild after the disaster of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years and nothing done about that. ,39,TimOfAltona
1423,"In all seriousness little point in holding out for Shorten to reach the Lodge - never happen - so the LNP is all we've got for the foreseeable future, may as well work with Turnbull on this. ",38,TimOfAltona
1424,Give him time. He needs a strong win at the next election to consolidate his leadership and take the party back towards the highly popular middle and keep them in govt for years to come. ,36,TimOfAltona
1425,Plibersek is a weak performer in parliament - comes across as indecisive and she lacks the oratory skills needed tolead a party like labor when it's on its knees as it is at the moment.,35,TimOfAltona
1426,You need to go back and look at his history.....classic faceless man of the Labor party...destroying not one PM but two Labor PMs on his way to the top....plenty more too when you delve into his distant past.,38,TimOfAltona
1427,Damn First Dog - saves his best cartoon of the year until I am ensconced in deepest darkest Southern India where the internet fails faster than an Australian Labor leaders popularity...that said brilliant piece and reinforces pretty much everything I have said since Sept 2013. ,46,TimOfAltona
1428,"On another subject - being in India and seeing first hand the effects of coal burning, particularly in the acutely impoverished rural areas brings into question the whole issue of coal and it's detrimental effects on people's health and well being. ",42,TimOfAltona
1429,"The problem is cost and renewables are just too expensive for the Indian government to invest heavily in, particularly rural areas where everything is coal powered because it is dirt cheap and accessible to everyone. ",36,TimOfAltona
1430,"How much Australian coal I've seen burning in the villages of Southern India I have no idea, but one thing is clear, if Australia pulls supply, the Indians will certainly fill the gap with coal from other nations. ",39,TimOfAltona
1431,It looks more like a weak attempt by Labor to create mischief when they should be working out how they can reform and try and win back government in the next 2 or 3 terms.,35,TimOfAltona

1434,Contrast that with advice/direction the ALP are forced to endure from their union puppet masters and everything seems a whole lot clearer as to why the ALP are so on the nose with the electorate.,35,TimOfAltona
1435,GST increase IS on the table and will not be ruled out. No point Labor flogging it - it's all in the mix with a total taxation reform paper.  ,31,TimOfAltona
1436,Can someone pass a note to Labor tacticians that flogging the 15% GST scare campaign is just about in the same territory as the failed and discredited Cayman Island tactic. ,31,TimOfAltona
1437,You seem to have gone missing in action when the ACT Labor government brought in almost identical legislation last month and the Victorian Labor government are certain to follow suit next year. ,33,TimOfAltona

1439,"It's just the ALP and their supporters desperate to try and land a blow on Turnbull as the government's popularity skyrockets and Labors is falling into dead and buried territory. Any thing will do, even feigned indignation over nothing at all like this one here. ",46,TimOfAltona
1440,No need to - you can read the leasing document on the NT Government website - it spells out exactly how the legislated powers and authority of Australian Border Force apply to the Port of Darwin - just as they do to all the other Australian ports operating under Public Private leasing arrangements.,53,TimOfAltona
1441,Not sure what all the fuss is about - apart from Labor trying to stir the pot following Obama raising the issue about something that had been in the public domain for months - perhaps the ALP should subscribe to the NT News as well and not wait until Obama mentions it before they start their feigned scare tactics. ,60,TimOfAltona
1442,I don't think even Labor are suggesting this presents a threat to national security - more to do with trying to create mischief for the government off the back of Obamas comment at APEC.,34,TimOfAltona
1443,They are on to it because that idiot Senator Conroy and the ALP tactics people got together and decided they can try and use it to wedge Turnbull. The Guardian Labor cheer squad all hop on board. ,38,TimOfAltona
1444,Please refrain from using the Caymans analogy - we attempted that class warfare tactic but it was a disaster and backfired on us big time. In fact Turnbull's popularity surged and Bill's plummeted to an all time low. ,39,TimOfAltona
1445,"It will be good to hear Katharine's summation of Turnbull's first outing on the big stage. She has been travelling with him for days and will have formed a good opinion on how he handled himself.

",73,TimOfAltona
1449,Lol... If he says that about the person the majority of Australians actually want as our PM...imagine what he would say about Bingle Bill...the man no one wants as our PM.,31,TimOfAltona
1450,At any examination a great first outing for Turnbull on the world stage. Given he has only been PM for figuratively speaking 5 minutes this would have been a great learning curve for him. ,35,TimOfAltona
1451,On his return he needs to do some serious work on domestic policy framework. Presumably his ministers have been working on that during his absence. We've seen a few glimpses in recent days.,33,TimOfAltona
1452,Their tacticians had them attempting for 2 or 3 days to play the man only to discover it had backfired spectacularly on them and achieved nothing more than to further boost Turnbull's popularity coupled with a rapid decrease in Shorten's approval rating. Labor dropped it like a hot potato and have avoided it ever since. ,56,TimOfAltona
1453,If only the factional warlords and union puppet masters would allow some of that talent into the front bench then it could be the beginning of a new era for Labor.,31,TimOfAltona
1454,No where near as delusional as you it seems - going by your hundreds of comments on these threads proclaiming Labor are way out in front of the LNP and on track for a landslide win over the Turnbull government next year. ,43,TimOfAltona
1455,"I think Katharine is right, it is not only world leaders who like what they see in Malcolm Turnbull, Australian voters are also impressed by what they see so far and the polls reflect precisely that. ",37,TimOfAltona
1456,"Consider this - whilst Turnbull was rubbing shoulders and in meetings with Obama, Putin, Abe, Merkel , Cameron and others, Australia's 'alternative' PM was randomly smashing into parked cars in a Carlton street after, according to Labor spin merchants at least, spilling coffee in his lap. The same spin merchants proclaimed that this was 'reported' to police yet funny thing, Victoria police advised they have no record of that. Can Shorten become any more of a liability for Labor?

1457,"At the end of the day, we are all hoping to see an end to the revolving door of Australian PMs and unfortunately for the increasingly hapless and directionless Labor party, Turnbull is looking like just the person to deliver on that.",42,TimOfAltona

1464,I think however most of those posting on this thread can see Labor are all but finished for the foreseeable future so have nothing left but personal attacks and delusional rants trying to put a brave face on what is a hopeless situation for them.,45,TimOfAltona
1465,Right here is Labor's greatest worry - they are losing votes to the Turnbull government. Some will be going to Greens and Independent's but there are an increasing number who are switching to Turnbull for no other reason than Shorten is widely seen as a man who will never be a PM in this country. ,56,TimOfAltona

1470,"The lefties don't like it because it shows up their man who can't pass first base, never will, so all they have left in their kit bag are grubby and vitriolic comments aimed at a popular Lib PM.",38,TimOfAltona
1471,Two minutes after Malcolm's victory speech following another LNP landslide win next year you will be on a Guardian thread proclaiming 'it's over for the Lib/Nats at the upcoming federal 2019 election.' ,33,TimOfAltona
1472,"Something tells me Katharine, we will never ever see in the future a photo of Bill Shorten at the podium alongside Angela Merkel or any other world leader for that matter.",31,TimOfAltona
1473,Labor get the replies they deserve - wedge questions bordering on childish socialist inspired rants that end up backfiring on them. Reality is they are no match for Turnbull or the government and it shows. ,36,TimOfAltona
1474,Pleasing to see Katharine travelling with our( increasingly ) popular PM. What a fantastic trip for her to witness first hand Malcolm Turnbull's first foray onto the world stage as our PM. ,33,TimOfAltona
1475,Despited daily mantras that Abbott was the worst PM ever and had to go - what they really meant was he had to go  - then the unthinkable happened and they all had the rug pulled out from under them by Malcolm Turnbull's arrival as PM. ,48,TimOfAltona
1476,No I think you may have got a bit confused over timings. All the spying allegations on the President and his wife occurred I think during the Gillard Labor government - lead to a catastrophe in Indo-Australian relations which the LNP government had to come in and repair.,48,TimOfAltona
1477,This will be a positive trip to showcase Malcolm on the world stage. The outcome likely to help cement Turnbull's authority over his party and elevate his (already high) popularity with the electorate. ,34,TimOfAltona
1478,You know what your problem is don't you - you are so blinkered and fixated on the media as being responsible for the demise of the modern day Labor Party that you cannot see that Labor are mostly responsible for the dire situation it finds itself in. ,48,TimOfAltona
1479,Surprising how many negative comments on here about Julie Bishop. The Labor cheer squad should be thanking her for her part in the removal of Tony Abbott - the man they all wanted gone as PM - they should be praising her! ,43,TimOfAltona
1480,I think you will find Tanya's gripe with Bishop is more to do with Julie's involvement in the removal of Abbott which has seemingly snuffed out any hope Labor had of forming the next government.,35,TimOfAltona
1481,"Yes, I think you could be onto something. All the G20 leaders have been in on the conspiracy to time their next meeting to coincide with Charles and Camilla visit to Australia so that Turnbull, who was not PM when the meeting was scheduled, could be whisked out of the country to save him embarrassment. ",56,TimOfAltona
1482,Something to do with Labor being a shadow of its former self with a leader no one wants and unable to extract itself from the culture of division and failure evident to all during the disaster of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years.,40,TimOfAltona
1483,"Any proposed changes will first need to be agreed on by the government and then taken to the states for them to agree/approve any amendments. Once agreement by the states, Labor and Liberal is reached it is then taken to the voters to decide at the next election. ",49,TimOfAltona
1484,"Keep up with the play Daisy, any change to the GST first has to approved by the state premiers and then it is taken to the election to allow voters to decide. ",33,TimOfAltona
1485,"Funny thing, I was about to say the exact same thing about Bill Shorten - what is the point of Labor sticking with him, because as with Julia Gillard before him, he can only lead the party over the cliff next election.",42,TimOfAltona
1486,...and the delusional conspiracy theories continue. When will the Labor cheer squad just admit that sometimes there are awful Labor governments in power and sooner or later it all catches up with them and they are thrown out of office - a bit like in Sept 2013.,47,TimOfAltona
1487,We hear the ALP are on the lookout for a new leader - that bloke with the top hat outside Flinders St looks like he may be just the ticket.,30,TimOfAltona
1488,"Actually I did not support Abbott - I supported the LNP government and admittedly I did stick up for him over some of the outrageous comments against him in Guardian threads, however I was just as relieved as everyone else when he departed. I have always backed a Turnbull leadership of the LNP - have done so for the past 10 years.",62,TimOfAltona
1489,Can someone in the Labor advisors box pass a note to Shorten and Plibersek that they have already been found out on their confected scare campaign and Turnbull is having them on toast every time they raise the GST.,39,TimOfAltona
1490,"Returning to the bigger picture here, will Shorten have the guts to put up a Labor candidate in the North Sydney by election or has he already thrown in the towel?",31,TimOfAltona
1491,It's there for all to see - except perhaps the blinkered ones in this thread who live in denial of the fact that Labor are in all sorts of bother.,30,TimOfAltona
1492,"Just as Newspoll was a good reflection of voters impressions on the Abbott government, the latest poll is a good reflection of voters views on the Turnbull government vs how voters view the current Labor opposition. ",37,TimOfAltona
1493,If this continues into next year I'm picking the pressure will mount against Shorten from within his own party and we may yet see a repeat of 2013 where Rudd was installed at the last moment to save some Labor furniture. ,42,TimOfAltona
1494,Of course they could always embark on a promised program of reform and rebuild to try and make themselves competitive for the 2019 or 2022 elections - now there's a thought.,31,TimOfAltona
1495,"Reading some of the Labor/Greens cheer squad comments directed at Peter Dutton, most of them highly abusive, it makes one reflect on the fact that the Immigration portfolio is akin to the poison chalice...does not matter one iota who the Immigration Minister is, he or she will be targeted by the lefties who are angry that the government's stop the boat policy has been so successful. ",67,TimOfAltona
1496,The party you want in government had more of these issues to deal with when they were in government and they dealt with them in the same way the current government is dealing with them. ,36,TimOfAltona
1497,That is unless you subscribe to the Greens 'open borders' ideology and allow everyone who can get here without visas to move immediately into the community and live off welfare.,30,TimOfAltona
1498,"Let's face it, if matters not who the Immigration Minister is, he or she will always walk around with a target in their forehead for the Labor/Greens cheer squad to take aim.",32,TimOfAltona
1499,Christmas Island has nothing to do with it. This sort of thing was going on in mainland detention centres during the Gillard government after they lost control of the borders and reopened numerous centres to accommodate people claiming asylum. ,40,TimOfAltona
1500,Here's a tip - a slew of comments from the same old Labor/Greens cheer squad members who frequent the Guardian threads are not representative of the rest of Australia who rate Turnbull and government significantly higher than they rate the hapless Labor party. ,44,TimOfAltona
1501,The ALP are staring down the barrel of a lengthy period in opposition IMO unless they can admit the party needs urgent reform and actually start doing something about it. ,31,TimOfAltona
1502,"I'm with you. We only want to hear pro-Labor propaganda in the media - any other views or opinions , particularly those reflecting reality and what the majority of Australians think should be totally muzzled.  ",37,TimOfAltona
1503,Not some clouded leftie delusion that somehow Labor will rise from the ashes and strike down the Turnbull government by banging out a few choruses of 'Solidarity Forever' whilst their leader descends to wipeout status in the polls.,38,TimOfAltona
1504,"Daisy, you can bury your head in the sand and pretend everything is rosy down in Labor land but those of us living in the real world know very differently. ",31,TimOfAltona
1505,The ALP promised reform after the disaster of the Rudd/Gillard years then sat back and did diddly squat under Shorten who thought all he had to do was 'be there' at the next election to win against Tony Abbott. ,40,TimOfAltona
1506,"Now that Turnbull has arrived, Shorten and the ALP have been caught out like the proverbial shag on a rock with no reform, no rebuild and no chance of winning an election. ",33,TimOfAltona
1507,So keen is he to restart those boats so that Australia can soak up as many people as possible that want to come here that he turns a blind eye to the deaths at sea that are the by product of the Greens refugee policy. ,46,TimOfAltona
1508,We have seen this here in Australia with illegal drug shipments hidden in cargo moving through airports on and off planes with the help of corrupt baggage handlers at Sydney Airport. ,32,TimOfAltona
1509,The same can easily apply to terrorist acts - particularly in poorer countries like Egypt where it would not take much to recruit a security cleared airport worker either for cash or on ideology grounds or both. ,38,TimOfAltona
1510,"......and we will continue to hold him to account. If he is not up to the scrutiny then he isn't PM material - something most Australian voters, including many Labor voters have worked out ages ago - hence his popularity is heading towards Gillard type poll ratings.",47,TimOfAltona
1511,"Shorten may have been 'personally cleared' for now, but there are a raft of other union officials, current and former, who are in the firing line going by evidence presented in the past few weeks. ",36,TimOfAltona
1512,Daisy trust me - this does not mean that Shorten will suddenly morph into the preferred PM or Labor suddenly will take the lead in the polling because of this decision. ,32,TimOfAltona
1513,I suspect what Leigh is really saying is that the only people who vote for Labor should be allowed to vote - no one else is eligible because they are all too thick. ,34,TimOfAltona
1514,"She weakened the Labor party to the point they were all but decimated at the last election. It was only Rudd's intervention that saw them hold onto 50 odd seats in parliament. Had Gillard not been knifed by her own party, they would be lucky to have 30 seats today. ",51,TimOfAltona
1515,Now he's been caught flat-footed and no where to go with Turnbull as PM. The polls reflect what the nation think of him as an alternative PM and the ALP are once again struggling for relevancy and purpose. ,39,TimOfAltona
1516,"Daisy claims she used to be a Liberal voter but swapped when Abbott came along - funny thing, she is cooking up all kinds of anti-Turnbull messaging which pretty much confirms where she stood all along IMO.",37,TimOfAltona
1517,"Let the lefties like Stephen have their ideological rant against the overall wisdom of a GST increase, get it out of their system and then we all move on as the GST increases to 15% with hardly a ripple, oh, apart from the states having a whole lot more money to pour into health, education and infrastructure.",57,TimOfAltona
1518,"Low paid union members will be thankful the government are protecting their best interests - the polls indicate Labor are bleeding votes to the LNP, I wonder how many are union members disillusioned with Labor's perceived protection racket around criminality and corruption within the union movement?",46,TimOfAltona
1519,They may make Labor and their supporters feel a little better amongst themselves but reality is their stunts generally back fire on them resulting in a further drop in the polls. ,32,TimOfAltona
1520,If the government go the election on a platform for a GST increase and are returned then Labor will need to pull their increasingly irrelevant head in and let it pass. ,32,TimOfAltona
1521,"This has already been played out in NZ where John Key first went to an election with the case for a GST increase and not only won convincingly, he also convincingly won the two subsequent elections after NZ had experienced the 15% for two terms of conservative government. It is broad based in NZ too. ",56,TimOfAltona
1522,Not saying this one is somehow fabricated but there have certainly been some spurious allegations made by those trying every avenue to try and force the government to allow them settle in Australia. ,34,TimOfAltona
1523,"You can tell by the comments in this thread, the Labor/Greens cheer squad have all but given up any remote hope they had of winning any kind of federal election, so all that's left for them are grubby and repulsive personal attacks in those who will be leading this nation for the next few years. ",56,TimOfAltona
1524,"Is it an ideological thing, or is it just an indication that they have been defeated and they have nothing else left in their war chest other than coming up with childish names for their opponents? ",37,TimOfAltona
1525,"This looks like yet another stunt by Shorten and Labor - here's s tip Bill, the islanders in those Pacific island nations can't actually vote in next year's election. ",30,TimOfAltona
1526,A stunt because Labor actually don't get a seat at the table in Paris with the PM and other world leaders - this is nothing more than smoke and mirrors by Labor trying to create an impression of climate credibility - another fail by the hapless Shorten and equally hapless Plibersek.,51,TimOfAltona
1527,If you agree with what is happening in Europe is in the best interests of European nations then you sit within a minority grouping and will forever remain there IMO.,30,TimOfAltona
1528,You miss the point entirely. Your 'solution' creates the perfect business model for people smugglers to restart their trade and lure tens of thousands onto the ocean in unseaworthy boats.,30,TimOfAltona
1529,"I was in Paris recently and you can't tell me that the impromptu 'camps' springing up all over the city, mainly around Priphrique and next to railway lines and occupied by mainly African and middle eastern migrants is not going to cause social and economic upheaval in the years ahead, particularly as thousands more seem to be flooding into the city each month. ",64,TimOfAltona
1530,Germany will be in the same boat in time to come. A country cannot sustain an uncontrolled influx of millions of people without serious ramifications to it's social and economic fabric. ,32,TimOfAltona
1531,This development may be good news. We all want to see the offshore processing centres closed down as they were under the Howard government (unfortunately only to be reopened by a desperate Labor government who had totally lost control of our borders) and the only way this can be achieved is to resettle the people still there in countries other than Australia.  ,64,TimOfAltona
1532,It's perplexing how the Greens seem very relaxed by the thought of an active people smuggling operation sending thousands of people by boat to Australia with countless perishing along the way. ,32,TimOfAltona
1533,Your solution gives them a product to sell and hey presto we are back to the dark days of the Rudd Labor government with people drowning in their hundreds en route to Australia.,33,TimOfAltona
1534,So Di Natale is still pushing for all these people in offshore processing centres be allowed to settle in Australia only to be followed shortly thereafter by hundreds of people smuggler boats carrying tens of thousands of people also wanting to be resettled in Australia.  ,47,TimOfAltona
1535,I think this almost confirms in many people's minds that Shorten' is wholly unelectable and his days are numbered - luckily for the government the ALP are forced to keep him in place until after the next election - their dilemma is who have they got in their senior ranks who can pick up the pieces and start all over again? ,62,TimOfAltona
1536,"People can drone on about coal, climate change, welfare benefits, budget deficits and Nauru all they like, it will make not an iota of difference to the election outcome. ",30,TimOfAltona
1537,It starts with sorting out the negative influence of the unions and their factions which saw the hapless Shorten inserted into the leadership ahead of a better equipped and competent Albo.,31,TimOfAltona
1538,"Thanks to Rudd, Labor are pretty much stuck with Shorten until at least the next election. This is great news for the Turnbull government and in all probability will translate to a landslide win for the LNP next year .  ",42,TimOfAltona
1539,"No doubt Shorten will step aside 'for the good of the party' after the election, but right here is where it looks even more ominous for Labor, they simply don't have anyone of Turnbull's calibre on their front bench. Most are tired worn out hacks still carrying the considerable baggage from the disaster of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years. ",58,TimOfAltona
1540,"I'm with you - if journos are going to continue to report on this what they see nonsense, all that's remaining is to close your eyes, put your fingers in your ears and jump up and down on the spot and maybe that will help make Shorten and Labor look a little better than they actually are.",57,TimOfAltona
1541,"Labor will be thinking post the next election loss and should be getting back to the basics they promised but never started......reform, rebuild, renew the leadership and try and make themselves into a credible alternative government in time for the 2019 election.",42,TimOfAltona
1542,"I would rate The Netherlands as perhaps the most tolerant and culturally diverse nation on the planet, yet even there Geert Wilders Party for Freedom is attracting a fair chunk of the popular vote which could even in time see Wilders party form government. ",45,TimOfAltona
1543,"contrasts the mood in Australia with the growing hostility to immigration in Europe. In the last fortnight, elections have seen one far right anti-immigration party surging in popularity in Switzerland and another taking power in Poland. ",37,TimOfAltona
1544,"David, do you think this may have something to do with the fact that Europe lost control of it's borders which has seen hundreds of thousands of migrants originating from Middle East and Africa flood into Southern Europe trying to make their way to wealthier countries? ",47,TimOfAltona
1545,"Contrast this with Australia who have maintained control over its borders, has a generous yet regulated and controlled migrant and refugee intake allowing for positive assimilation into the community with housing, health. education and welfare support in abundance. ",39,TimOfAltona
1546,"Had Australia continued down the path of Europe which we were for a while under the Rudd/Gillard Labor years and is the model the Greens campaign for, I suspect Australians' views on social cohesion would be a little different to those contained in the latest report.",46,TimOfAltona
1547,"I'm with you, the polls clearly indicate Shorten and Labor are headed for a convincing win. How many seats do you think the LNP will lose in the lower house? 20, perhaps 30 seats, maybe more? ",37,TimOfAltona
1548,To put it in context - he is referring to removing the people smugglers business model to stop people moving from countries they are already safe in ie Turkey or Greece and trying to make it to Germany where earlier this year Angela Merkel gave the people smugglers a product to sell. It seems Germany has since decided to tighten it's immigration policy due to over whelming numbers arriving in the country from Turkey and Greece. ,77,TimOfAltona
1549,"Had the government not adopted a strict border protection policy the processing centres on and off shore would not have a handful of people as they do today, but tens of thousands of men, women and children. ",38,TimOfAltona
1550,On top of that how many thousands would have drowned attempting to reach Australia by people smuggler boats? Abhorrent that the Refugee Council and other advocates go silent when it comes to discussing mass drownings and how the government's policy has saved perhaps thousands of lives. ,47,TimOfAltona
1551,Fair to say that anytime Shorten opens his mouth on any topic from here on in it will be viewed with suspicion as nothing more than some scripted piece emanating from a Labor focus group on how do we best wedge Turnbull.  ,44,TimOfAltona
1552,Turnbull needs a strong win at the next election to give him the internal authority and mandate to continue with policy reform as he edges the government back towards the sensible centre. ,33,TimOfAltona
1553,Jenny Macklins announcement today on spending promises if Labor are elected is at the heart of Labor's problem - rolling out worn out front benchers left over from the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd disaster to announce funding for programs with no idea how it will be paid for is classic Labor and something people instantly dismiss as nothing more than smoke and mirrors. ,61,TimOfAltona
1554,"I'm hanging out for when Shorten drops to low teens as preferred PM and Turnbull is hovering around the mid-70's and the 2PP has LNP high 50's to Labor's low 40's our mate Finnigans comes on to announce ""it's all over for the LNP"" ",45,TimOfAltona
1555,We see this time and time again in Guardian Australia political threads - as soon as polls start reflecting what the Labor cheer squad don't want to see all the conspiracy theorists start ramping up. ,36,TimOfAltona
1556,"Spot on - if you stick your fingers in your ears, close your eyes and jump up and down it will block out the reality that Labor are headed for a massive shellacking at the next federal election.",38,TimOfAltona
1557,"Anyone will tell you, including the media observers, that the whole tone of QT has altered due to Turnbull's response to Labor's questioning on issues - he is giving a full and considered reply. ",35,TimOfAltona
1558,You are wrong - he is not sticking to the Abbott government script at all - the language and the message have changed - this is why the polls are where they are. People like what they see. It's very early days but you can expect to see the government moving back towards the middle piece by piece. A winning formula. ,62,TimOfAltona
1559,You see the big difference is that Gillard was tracking as the most unpopular PM in the nations history which made Rudds return a relatively straight forward affair - even Bill Shorten jumped onto the Rudd bandwagon and grabbed the knife out of the Labor Party cutlery draw. ,49,TimOfAltona
1560,Not sure whether he will last the distance to the next election...presumably he will resign the leadership for 'the good of the party' after the next election which pretty much the whole country tips the LNP under Turnbull to win comfortably - an increase in LNP lower house seats is not out of the question.,55,TimOfAltona
1561,The problem the ALP have is that their leader is probably sitting just to the right of Malcolm Turnbull and he &amp; his party can't possibly survive in that environment.,30,TimOfAltona
1562,If the country delivers Malcolm a strong endorsement at the next election he will have the internal authority to move government policies closer to territory seemingly abandoned by Labor in the last few years. ,35,TimOfAltona
1563,Those on the left who bleated he is no different to Tony Abbott because he didn't change the world within 24 hrs of assuming the Liberal leadership ( and yes there were plenty of them in these threads) should now reflect on the fact that he is piece by piece moving the government towards adopting a more conciliatory approach to policies deemed unpalatable under Abbott. ,66,TimOfAltona
1564,Moving the government back towards the centre is the objective and will take time but the signs are clearly there and this is exactly what has Labor spooked at the moment. ,32,TimOfAltona
1565,The level of consultation and inclusion within the minor parties and independents on key policy issues from the new government is unprecedented and Turnbull seems intent on taking the country with him as he builds for reform across key economic and social issues. ,44,TimOfAltona
1566,Turnbull needs to have a strong win at the next election to give him the authority/mandate to accelerate change within his party and the country and I reckon voters will deliver that for him in spades.,36,TimOfAltona
1567,"Labor are not seen as a viable party to lead the country so unless you are inferring that either the Greens or Palmer United Party will be the new government, I think you will find that the LNP under Turnbull are here for the long term.",46,TimOfAltona
1568,"I'm with you, it's very important we only read pro-Labor puff prices in the Guardian - we don't want to see or hear anything at all positive about the new government or Malcolm Turnbull - everything written about the government must be negative. ",44,TimOfAltona
1569,It's still early days and Labor have been unsuccessful in landing any punches and after their disastrous foray into the Cayman Islands which backfired big time they are finding it difficult to gain any ground on the government. ,39,TimOfAltona
1570,The ALP's biggest threat here is that their leader is caught up in the thick of it...not a good look for a bloke who day dreams he might be PM one day.,32,TimOfAltona
1571,After what Bill Shorten did to the glorious Julia Gillard by knifing her then tossing her on the political reject pile I'm very surprised you are such a fan of his. ,32,TimOfAltona
1572,"No one looking at this objectively would try and rebrand it as Turnbull event, perhaps only a few bitter and twisted Labor supporters who see Turnbull as their biggest threat to ever returning to government IMO.",36,TimOfAltona
1573,"Fair to say not just the scientists, but the whole of Australia has a sigh of relief that Tony has moved to the back bench and Malcolm is our new PM. Abbott's intentions were good but he was a shocking salesman and pushed too hard on policies electorally unpopular. He did achieve outstanding results on solving the deaths at sea tragedy which may be his greatest legacy. ",68,TimOfAltona
1574,Not sure why you guys get all hot and bothered over one poll - there will be hundreds between now and the next election - some will show the government charging ahead and some will show Labor gaining ground. ,40,TimOfAltona
1575,The big disappointment for Labor will be it will be forever written in the history books that it was a conservative government under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull who presided over 'legalising' same sex marriage in Australia in the year 2017. ,41,TimOfAltona
1576,I don't recall we had any say when Kim Beazley was made Ambassador to the US nor did we have any say when Abbott extended his term there when the LNP won government - do you?,36,TimOfAltona
1577,Turnbull is an accomplished performer in parliament - unfortunately for Labor they have no one who comes even close to the oratory skills of the PM and it shows. ,30,TimOfAltona
1578,Apparently unless Shorten resigns ( a possibility) it takes 60% or more of the Labor caucus have to vote against Bill before they pull the knife out of the party room cutlery drawer.  ,35,TimOfAltona
1579,"By next year Labor will be languishing on a 2PP in the low 40's , Shortens approval will be he headed to the low 20's and Turnbull's will be up in the stratosphere somewhere in the high 70's and the LNP 2PP in the mid 50's. ",47,TimOfAltona
1580,Nice try - I'm picking the LNP will increase their lower house numbers - almost a certainty after Chris Bowen confirmed on 7.30 tonight that Bill Shorten will remain Labor leader at least until the next federal election. ,39,TimOfAltona
1581,Instead of them reading out questions scripted from Shorten's office designed to try and wedge the government or shabby ill-conceived questions trying to target Turnbull's successful business career they may also like to ask questions their respective electorates may have an interest in. ,44,TimOfAltona
1582,Something to do with Turnbull comfortably settling into a long term prime ministership whilst Labor thrash around on pointless and damaging ugly politics to try and score political points...everything is backfiring for them hence the vitriol.,36,TimOfAltona
1583,Labor need to start making themselves relevant and relevant quickly or else they risk bleeding big chunks of their vote across to the LNP - it's already started but putting Macklin up there flogging a dead Labor horse is not a good look.,43,TimOfAltona
1584,I think today's announcement confirms what the majority of Australians are thinking - that Malcolm Turnbull represents a safe pair of hands when it comes to managing the economy. The polls are starting to reflect that fact. ,38,TimOfAltona
1585,Their feeble attempt to portray Turnbull as some kind of demon because he has been very successful in business has backfired spectacularly and they even bled votes to the LNP over that little tactical disaster.,35,TimOfAltona
1586,You see you only focus on one part of the equation. If all you want to do is close the off shore facilities people are certain to die at sea as a result of the well intentioned objective. ,39,TimOfAltona
1587,"Geeze, the last person you would want endorsing your campaign is Julia Gillard - talk about the kiss of death - do the Yanks know she almost single handedly wiped out her own political party in Australia?",37,TimOfAltona
1588,"But that would mean opening up our borders with no restrictions to anyone who wants to come here and allows drugs and illegal firearms to be freely imported to flood Australian streets with misery and crime - no thanks, I'd prefer we held onto Border Force and let them do their job.",52,TimOfAltona
1589,"Not only was Peris a captains pick from the failed Gillard era which angered her party no end, I doubt she was there for any good reason other then shit stirring. Border Force were right to deny her entry to the facility. ",43,TimOfAltona
1590,You need to catch up with that story - Labor have dropped it like a hot potato because they are bleeding votes to the LNP over their bungled attempt to create a feigned class warfare last week. LOL,38,TimOfAltona
1591,Ahh the same old failed tactic - when all else fails and the polls are showing your party is on the ropes - start attacking the polls as a conspiracy. ,31,TimOfAltona
1592,Shorten inspires no one - your only hope is for Shorten to hand over the key to the Labor Party cutlery draw he has been hiding since becoming leader and allow the party to get the knife out and do what needs to be done.,45,TimOfAltona
1593,"I think Malcolm may wait until Labors primary vote drops to 20%, then he may have a crack which means the Libs will increase their lower house seats - this is a good thing.",34,TimOfAltona
1594,"Labor were hoping Abbott would prevail and they have been caught out, floundering around and directionless against a PM who is slowly entrenching his party into a long term government. ",31,TimOfAltona
1595,"If he is somehow caught, they need to ship him up to US and imprison him in a maximum security US federal prison - no prison in Mexico can hold him because of the rampant corruption down there.",38,TimOfAltona
1596,"Well no one can accuse the government, supported by Labor, of not being resolute in enforcing the current policy that those choosing to try to come to Australia by paying people smugglers will never gain entry to the country. ",40,TimOfAltona
1597,It may appear a harsh policy but the upside is that people are no longer drowning in their hundreds as they were when the previous Labor/Greens government furnished the people smugglers a business model to ply their insidious trade and the other big upside is that by enforcing a strict policy the offshore processing centres will eventually close down just as they were under the Howard government. That is a good thing.,72,TimOfAltona
1598,They flew her to Australia because she was requesting an abortion which was not available in Nauru. When she arrived she mysteriously changed her mind and was returned to Nauru.,30,TimOfAltona
1599,You would think that Turnbull would check and double check and then check again the voracity of the advice channeled to him before he said anything publicly on this issue. ,31,TimOfAltona
1600,"Interestingly this whole situation is based on allegations with not much fact including an allegation of rape.It is reported in the Guardian that this woman was pregnant as a result of rape, yet this is an allegation only as it is only her story with nothing to support it - the investigating Nauruan police said there was no evidence physical or otherwise to support her allegation. ",67,TimOfAltona
1601,What blows me away is this whole situation has cost over $100k to first fly her to Australia and them fly her back when she refused to go through with the termination which was the whole purpose of her trip to Australia in the first place. ,47,TimOfAltona
1602,Why do these advocates go silent or missing when mass drownings occur as a result of asylum seekers believing if they get on boats they can reach Australia and settle here? ,32,TimOfAltona
1603,"The comments on here are reminiscent of the ones following the stories about asylum seekers being allegedly tortured by the RAN which when the real facts came out, turned out to be a fabrication by the asylum seekers involved who were trying to fleece compensation out of the government. ",50,TimOfAltona
1604,Best people wait until the facts surrounding this are fully reported before jumping in and condemning the government - this has all the hallmarks of being revealed as something very different from what is being portrayed by Ian Rintoul. ,40,TimOfAltona
1605,Every nation has the right to protect its own borders - there is plenty more to this situation than has been reported here and the facts will emerge in time. ,31,TimOfAltona
1606,"This situation is curious and does not add up - this person was demanding a termination for some time on Nauru and pushed for, along with the refugee advocates, to travel to Australia for the termination. ",37,TimOfAltona
1607,"You feel sympathy for this woman, but what happened between wanting to come to Australia for a termination and on arrival refusing medical assistance which is now leading to her being returned to Nauru? ",35,TimOfAltona
1608,"Hate to bring this up but on my regular visits to Vietnam, it is not difficult to find dog on the menu in restaurants, even in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh CBD and you also see live dogs cruelly crammed into cages for sale in some food markets especially in rural areas for that express purpose - offensive and distressing in the extreme.

1609,"If ever there was a good cause to support, it is to stop the Vietnamese dog meat industry which sees thousands of dogs of all breeds bashed to death for human consumption.",32,TimOfAltona

1611,Barry Cassidy on the ABC and Richo on Sky were scathing of Labor's grubby attempt to attack Turnbull over his wealth. Richo went on to say that if Labor don't change their tune very quickly on this they will bleed votes.,41,TimOfAltona
1612,This is exactly why this has already backfired on Labor. perhaps the lesson they will learn out of this is to play the ball and not the man if they want to have any hope of getting back into government one day.,42,TimOfAltona
1613,We all get that Bill Shorten's personal approval rating is in the gutter and about to enter the sewer whilst his opponent's approval rating is heading the opposite direction into the stratosphere so it was always on the cards that Labor strategists would at some point try and use Turnbull's financial status to try and score points. ,58,TimOfAltona
1614,"Pretty much every journo across Fairfax, News and Guardian have already dismissed Labor's attempts to paint the PM as doing something shifty with his finances as amateurish and disingenuous. Shorten now looks stupid and no doubt will be back peddling on this over the next few days. ",48,TimOfAltona
1615,What a load of rubbish you keep posting - Please show where Turnbull pays zero tax - you can't because he does - so why do you keep posting lies?,30,TimOfAltona
1616,"That said, the Australian GST rate is about the lowest in the developed world, way behind most other developed economies. Time to have a look at it - 12.5 or 15% is not a bad start, but still behind other countries.",41,TimOfAltona
1617,Very good article in Fairfax on how Labor and their supporters are all going to end up with egg on their collective grubby faces over this confected attack on Turnbull...,30,TimOfAltona
1618,All Shorten has 'focussed' on is how to wedge Turnbull over his financial affairs - waste of time and shows Labor to be devoid of any ideas that may actually help the country. ,34,TimOfAltona
1619,Australians are sick and tired of gutter politics being played out in this country and Labor present as incapable of mounting a credible alternative government focussed on policy instead they seem focussed on playing the man.,36,TimOfAltona
1620,"The problem for Deucer and his ilk is that they know Turnbull stands in the way of a Labor government ever being returned to power in this country over the next few years, so it's all about grubby attacks on the man and even though it's all innuendo they live with the hope something will stick.  ",58,TimOfAltona
1621,Dastyari has a lot to answer for here in yesterday's failed attempt to try and throw shit at Turnbull over his financial arrangements - no doubt someone from Labor's tactics committee decided he would be their mouthpiece to try and spread anti-Turnbull propaganda. ,44,TimOfAltona
1622,I also think that it is more than a coincidence that this failed ploy by Labor is just one day after their bloke was seen to have major problems brewing down at the TURC over the Eastlink project. ,39,TimOfAltona
1623,This modern day Labor Party have been the epitome of gutter politics ever since they were nearly wiped out in 2013 - Shorten et al should be held responsible for the degradation in the parliament and the toxic political environment we have seen over the past couple of years. ,50,TimOfAltona
1624,"We all thought getting a new PM would change all that that, but no, Labor are still wallowing in self pity and dysfunction, completely devoid of any direction and looking down the barrel of 2 or 3 more terms in opposition whilst they grapple with reform and rebuild - so far nothing to show for it.",56,TimOfAltona
1625,This approach/attack by Labor was always on the cards.......hoping if they talk enough about the PM's wealth they can drum up some support from those who get off on demonising people others who have been financially successful with their lives whilst they have not. ,45,TimOfAltona
1626,Here's a tip for the hapless Labor party and Sam Dastyari - the world has moved on from the 1950's and 60's - the middle class are now the dominant socio-economic force in this country and not that many like what they see or hear from the modern day Labor Party. ,52,TimOfAltona
1627,The Labor/Greens cheer squad are tripping over each other with glee - thinking at last someone from Labor has dug into the archives and found something  they can use against the new PM = FAIL ,37,TimOfAltona
1628,The LNP Primary vote is upLabor primary vote has droppedTurnbull's approval rating has skyrocketedShorten's approval rating has nose dived yet againTwo weeks in and he already has the LNP neck and neck with Labor on 2PP - can only improve from here. ,43,TimOfAltona
1629,Wasting your time pointing out facts here - you are amongst people who have realised that their team cannot win now that Turnbull is Liberal leader so it's all about smear and vitriol as Labor go down the gurgler IMO.,40,TimOfAltona
1630,Throw as much manufactured vitriol as you can comrade - nothing changes the fact that Turnbull is likely to be our PM for the next few years at least. ,30,TimOfAltona
1631,Highly unlikely the Ukrainians would have driven the rocket launch vehicle back into central Russia still laden with 2 more missiles without Russian authorities intercepting or asking a question or two. ,32,TimOfAltona

1633,"If someone can come up with a solution that will see the offshore detention centres emptied, the occupants relocated without restarting the deadly maritime people smuggling operations then let's hear them. ",32,TimOfAltona
1634,Daisy you seem to be confused and mixing me up with someone else - I have never said anything of the sort about Tony Abbott and my prediction last year that Turnbull will at some point assume the Liberal leadership appears to be spot on. ,46,TimOfAltona
1635,"Well given there is no one from the Labor side who can stop him in NSW, he may as well go all the way one day and have a crack at federal politics - perhaps after another 2 or 3 terms as NSW Premier he may want a change. ",50,TimOfAltona
1636,This issue has nothing to with quantities of people killed - it is all to do with Islamic radicalisation of young Australians and the threat they may present in harming other Australians. ,33,TimOfAltona
1637,If it means that people aged 14+ who by their words or actions pose a threat to other Australians then there has to be a mechanism to deal with that - taking them off the street to both investigate and/or prevent a crime occurring before charges are laid is not unreasonable. ,52,TimOfAltona
1638,"Baird is on track to be one of NSWs longest serving Premiers - NSW Labor are gone for several terms.....you don't get to be the most popular senior politician in the country ( even ahead of Turnbull) by being irrational Daisy, people don't vote for you if you are and you don't have double the lead in the polls ahead of your nearest competitor if you are irrational.

1640,"Do they really think that applying control orders to 14 year olds, and locking people up without charge and without bringing them before a judge for more than 14 days, is a good way to combat radicalisation? ",38,TimOfAltona
1641,The problem the Labor/Greens cheer squad have here is that in using this proposed legislation as a platform to make the same tired old confected attacks on the government they start to look like they support putting civil liberties ahead of people's lives. ,44,TimOfAltona
1642,"Here's a tip - there are not many 14 or 15 year old boys or girls who plan to get a .38 calibre Smith &amp; Wesson hand gun, dress in black robes and wait outside a police station to shoot dead in the name of Islam the first person who walks out the front door, but if a 14 or 15 year old is planning on doing that and the police have reason to suspect an offence is about to be committed then most reasonable Australians would expect our laws to protect them from this act - the fact that the person committing the murder is 14 or 15 is irrelevant - the murder must be prevented. ",118,TimOfAltona
1643,I'm with you - like that time they banned the anti-abortionist fellow from the US last week and the time they set up the domestic violence task force headed by Australian of the Year Rosie Batty to assist women in danger from partners. ,44,TimOfAltona
1644,He shook his head when Turnbull challenged the Greens policy on asylum seekers and how it leads to mass drownings in the ocean - Bandt was mouthing 'not true'. ,30,TimOfAltona
1645,Labor need to think carefully before they try and be tricky with Turnbull - he is too smart for their lame wedge politics questions and he makes them look foolish. ,31,TimOfAltona
1646,Stupid first question from Shorten - don't know who is writing these for him but all he is doing is playing into the hands of Turnbull and getting crucified. ,30,TimOfAltona
1647,"What you are witnessing and perhaps what cuts you up the most, is that Turnbull is gradually moving the government back towards the centre, perhaps even territory that Labor abandoned long ago trying to keep up with the Abbott administration. ",41,TimOfAltona
1648,Not an easy answer at all - what about the highly probable hundreds or thousands who will perish at sea because Australia has opened up its borders to all comers who arrive by boat claiming asylum?,36,TimOfAltona

1652,"He has only been PM for a couple of weeks - give him time to change the national conversation and direction - won't happen overnight but it will happen in time, then watch the polls. ",36,TimOfAltona
1653,"It may be cheaper to have onshore processing centres, but as that gives the people smugglers their desperately needed business model, how many 'camps' would need to be built to house the tens of thousands making their way here on people smuggling boats?",43,TimOfAltona
1654,"It's pretty clear Labor's biggest single handicap, apart from being controlled by a plethora of factional union heavyweights and being wholly reliant on the Greens to get into government, is Bill Shorten. ",33,TimOfAltona
1655,The question is - how many more polls will it take to confirm that Shorten is as unpopular as a fart from last nights vindaloo in a crowded lift before the faceless men of the ALP reach for the Glen 20?,41,TimOfAltona
1656,"Garret may be correct, but the ALP can thank Rudd for the number of seats they have left in the lower house - at least he delivered on saving the furniture. ",32,TimOfAltona

1660,Ahhh...the tired and tattered remnants of a rapidly diminishing Labor cheer squad who can see that they have back the wrong horse and about to be trounced in next year's election. ,32,TimOfAltona
1661,Malcolm Turnbull is shifting the national conversation and in doing so is cementing himself in as a long term PM which is just what we are all calling for and demanding after the revolving door of Labor and Liberal leaders over the past 5 years.  ,47,TimOfAltona
1662,"Nice try, reality is that most voters don't want Shorten or Labor. While Labor talk about their unfunded policies, they are trying to divert the attention away from the lack of reform and rebuild promised after the failed Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years but never started. ",44,TimOfAltona
1663,This is looking like a long term government for Australia and is exactly what Australians' have been looking for since the revolving door leadership of both Labor and Liberal parties of the past 5 years. ,36,TimOfAltona
1664,"The hapless ALP scratching around trying to find something , anything, that they can use to differentiate themselves from a long term Turnbull LNP government which is on a roll. ",31,TimOfAltona
1665,There is a marked improvement in relations between the minority muslim community and government at both state and federal level especially in NSW and also since Turnbull assumed the prime ministership. ,32,TimOfAltona
1666,"Well, Labor's next PM is unlikely to be in the current front bench that's for sure - he/she could be hiding away on the backbench but most likely not even in parliament yet.",33,TimOfAltona
1667,"Bit premature David - Turnbull has only been PM for 3 weeks or so, give him time to settle in, change a few policies here and there, change the direction the previous government was headed and canter into a solid win in next year's election. ",46,TimOfAltona
1668,You are best to focus your efforts on the reform and rebuild of the Labor Party to try and arrive at some form of competitiveness in the 2019 election. ,30,TimOfAltona
1669,I think most Australians are looking forward to seeing Malcolm Turnbull in the top job for at least 2-3 terms. We are fed up with revolving door PMs of the past 5 years. ,34,TimOfAltona
1670,In the meantime Labor may want to start on their reform and rebuild program they thought they didn't need to start when Abbott was PM as they would just cruise into office by doing nothing. ,36,TimOfAltona
1671,"Germany will surely live to regret opening its borders so freely to hundreds of thousands of people who have no jobs, no homes and have to live off welfare for generations to come.",33,TimOfAltona
1672,Sadly many lefties in the Guardian threads have hijacked that term because they believe it gives strength to their argument...when in fact if they understood the actual meaning of that term in the context they use it they would think twice. ,42,TimOfAltona
1673,"To the Greens cheer squad I say this - Labor being in government is the closest thing you will ever have to actually being in government yourself - hence you direct preferences to Labor and then go looking for a return via policy formulation. problem is, Labor also promised reform and rebuild which has never eventuated under Shorten. ",59,TimOfAltona
1674,"To the Labor/Greens cheer squad I say this - the current government is in for the long haul, Australians are sick and tired of revolving door leadership. Turnbull pretty much represents the best in leadership for the country and it's starting to become pretty evident as the days/weeks go by.",50,TimOfAltona
1675,The Labor/Greens cheer squad are finally getting what they have been clamouring for after the current government had to come in and clean up the people smuggling disaster left behind by the failed Rudd/Gillard/Rudd regimes. ,36,TimOfAltona

1677,"Nice try TomTit, the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years almost destroyed the Labor party - she is the reason why Labor only have a handful of MPs left in the lower house. ",30,TimOfAltona

1679,"Labor's solution is and always has been that they have this secret magical money tree that funds all their policy promises - Plibersek was at it again today saying Australia should increase it's overseas aid spend back to the levels when Labor were in government - no idea how it will be paid for, but gee, it sounds really good Tania. ",62,TimOfAltona
1680,Very interesting article in Fairfax press today where Rosie Batty has applauded a transition to a Turnbull lead government saying we now have strong political leadership in this country compared to the recently departed Abbott administration.,36,TimOfAltona
1681,Good to see Julie Bishop representing Australia so well on the world stage and this is even before PM Malcolm Turnbull has started his overseas forays for meetings with global leaders. ,32,TimOfAltona

1683,This is a good thing - when it comes to fiscal reform everything should be on the table for consideration by any government. The productivity commission's report should lead the way here. ,33,TimOfAltona

1685,"As difficult as it is, the west needs to work with Assad to obliterate IS in Syria then put troops on the ground in Iraq to clear them out of there as well.",33,TimOfAltona
1686,Good news - it's clear the Labor/Greens cheer squad don't like any positive news about Julie Bishop and the work she does for Australia on the world stage - they only want to read negative stories.  ,38,TimOfAltona
1687,Let's just hope that after all the leadership instability of the past 5 years we settle down and see a PM in Malcolm Turnbull stay the course for another two or more terms in office.  ,37,TimOfAltona
1688,Labor should use these down time' years to start to reform and rebuild their party - it was promised after the failure of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years and the near wipe out but we have seen very little if anything occur. ,41,TimOfAltona
1689,"They need to start with their leadership, then work out their on again off again love affair with the Greens and then take a very hard look at the corrosive factional and union influence which destabilises their party time and time again.",42,TimOfAltona
1690,The best opportunity for him is after the expected resounding win at the polls next year where he will have a mandate and the authority within his party to effect change.,31,TimOfAltona

1692,"What happened was at this morning's announcement of the new domestic violence package, a journo asked Cash if she supported NZ in prohibiting Brown from entering that country due to his criminal conviction for violence. ",36,TimOfAltona
1693,We all saw what occurred when Rudd encouraged people to make their way to Australia via people smugger boat. A massive disaster at any examination with massive loss of life.,30,TimOfAltona
1694,The problem for you David is your views are held by an ever shrinking cabal of Labor cheer squadders trying to cling to a forlorn hope their party has some semblance of electability at the next election. ,38,TimOfAltona
1695,There will be more and more of this stuff coming out in coming weeks which will re-enforce in people's minds why a change to a Malcolm Turnbull lead government was both necessary and was applauded by most Australians. ,39,TimOfAltona
1696,"Turnbull has no choice but to stay the course - if he were to even hint that the new government may be softening its policy, the people smuggler boats laden with people will start departing Indonesia again - precisely why Labor also endorsed maintaining the government's tough border protection policy, including turn backs, should they gain government one day.",59,TimOfAltona
1697,Angela Merkel should have sought wise counsel from Kevin Rudd who tried the same thing when he set Australia up as the migrant/dis-placed persons magnet for SE Asia in 2007. We know the outcome from that. ,37,TimOfAltona
1698,"There is no easy solution, but creating the conditions that allow people to remain in their homeland, where most of them want to be, should be the long term objective. ",31,TimOfAltona
1699,"Any hint that things will be relaxed will see hundreds of boats laden with refugees headed our way once more, accompanied by the drownings and the necessity to reopen immigration detention centres - we have seen all this play out before during the failed Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years and it was a disaster for all concerned.

1700,"While we all want to see the offshore centres shut down, we cannot allow that to be the green light to start up the lucrative maritime people smuggling trade once more.",31,TimOfAltona
1701,If you can suggest to the government how they can resettle and empty out Nauru and Manus and close them down without restarting hundreds of boats with tens of thousands of refugees and perhaps thousands drowning as a result - they will be all ears.,45,TimOfAltona
1702,The Left don't like her because she was CoS to Tony Abbott when he was Opposition Leader &amp; was a key player in bringing down 3 sitting Labor Prime Ministers (with a little help from Labor factional warfare on the first 2) so they will forever direct their collective anger at her.,52,TimOfAltona
1703,"You would like to think that between the Greens, Labor and the Coalition they can come up with an agreed solution that prevents a candidate who attracts a whopping 0.51% of the primary vote being rewarded with a seat in the Australian Senate. ",44,TimOfAltona
1704,So as it turns out Abbott is gone and Shorten has to contend with a PM who has the potential to blow Labor's electoral chances out of the water anyway. ,31,TimOfAltona
1705,I see on Sky that Neil James from the Australian Defence Assn has given Marise the big thumbs up as Defence Minister given her wide ranging experience on Senate Defence committees over the years plus her first hand experience with visits to front line Australian military bases in Afghanistan. ,50,TimOfAltona
1706,This is a click bait 'nothing to see here story' only the Labor/Greens cheer squad salivate over whilst they ignore their own party seemingly falling apart at the seams IMO. ,31,TimOfAltona
1707,Your comment does raise a valid point. There are many Labor voters out there who would seriously consider voting for a Turnbull lead government ahead of a seemingly weakened and dysfunctional Labor party. ,34,TimOfAltona
1708,He danced around the pertinent question from Tony Jones about his involvement and negotiations with Thiess on the Eastlink project - the allegations around this are damning and could ultimately see him ousted as ALP leader - if the polls don't bring him down first. ,46,TimOfAltona
1709,"If Turnbull can demonstrate that he can bring his party and the country with him, then this is exactly the leadership and good government we have been asking for. ",30,TimOfAltona
1710,Nothing unites a party more and gets them falling in behind the leader than when that leader delivers them a significant lead in preferred PM plus a healthy 2PP majority. ,31,TimOfAltona
1711,Labor's worst fears have been realised and with Abbott's sudden departure they have been caught out with seemingly no plan or effective leadership to take them through to the next election. They were banking on constructing their entire campaign around Tony Abbott's unpopularity. ,44,TimOfAltona
1712,"Turnbull should capitalise on this early lead to push through key policy reform and it will be refreshing to see Labor, Greens and cross benchers in the senate with no choice but to back the new PM on some of his policy amendments. ",44,TimOfAltona

1715,Of course there will be fallout from such a stunning coup that has placed the LNP well and truly on the front foot and has left Labor washed aside and almost on the rocks in it's wake. ,38,TimOfAltona
1716,That way we only get exposed to positive spin from Labor and Greens and hear only negative spin about the government - that's the way it should be in our free and open democracy.,34,TimOfAltona
1717,You need to start changing your tune on Malcolm. One reason I am a huge supporter and have been for a long long time is I know he shares exactly the same concerns about West Papua. If any Australian PM is up for challenging Indonesia on their illegal occupation of that territory it is the one we have now. Successive Liberal and Labor governments have all looked the other way for fear of offending Indonesia. I'm confident Malcolm will find a way in time to address this issue. I know it is on his very extensive 'to do' list.,99,TimOfAltona
1718,"The only assumption you can make is Shorten saw Abbott as his keys to the Lodge, all he had to do was 'be there' and that has now been cruelly ripped away. ",33,TimOfAltona
1719,At any examination Labor have been caught out here - they were seriously banking on Abbott hanging around until the next election and hoping that would be enough for Shorten to fall over the line by doing nothing - just being there. ,43,TimOfAltona
1720,Maybe now they will be forced to deliver on their promise to reform and rebuild or risk being nothing more than a bit player being gradually replaced by the Greens.,30,TimOfAltona

1724,Will the Labor candidate turn up at the House of Reps in 3 weeks and see if can sneak into one of the multitude of empty seats up behind Bill Shorten?  ,33,TimOfAltona
1725,"Could have something to do with the fact that Labor had little to offer the local area plus most see Labor as unelectable federally with Shorten as leader, so they may as well have a representative in Canberra who is actually sits on the government benches. ",47,TimOfAltona
1726,"Also topical and relevant to this election is that Labor, on instructions from the CFMEU, are doing their best to block the China FTA - this act of attempted economic vandalism has a direct negative impact on businesses in Canning and will come to be a mill stone around the neck of Labor for years to come - even after they sort out their sad and sorry leadership dysfunction.",69,TimOfAltona
1727,A great result for the Libs after the turmoil of the past week. Hastie was clearly the superior candidate on the day and the voters of Canning have rewarded him with a seat in the House of Representatives. ,39,TimOfAltona
1728,"This was also a factor in the Liberal win, apart from the Libs having an outstanding candidate, people don't like what they see from Labor trying to destroy a massive economic benefit for Australia at a time when we need it most. ",43,TimOfAltona
1729,"The Labor cheer squad are amongst the sorest losers on the planet - many seem to be unable to accept that the people of Canning voted for the LNP candidate because in their opinion he was the better candidate out of the field of other candidates. For good reason, the vast majority of voters saw Andrew Hastie as the best person to represent them in Canberra. ",67,TimOfAltona
1730,"NEWSFLASH !!!! - Matt Keogh's campaign speech before the Turnbull coup has been leaked to the media, this certainly reaffirms his contention that it was all on local issues - ",31,TimOfAltona

1732,Funny how Labor fashioned their entire campaign around the slogan ' a vote for Andrew Hastie is a vote for Tony Abbott' only to have that cruelly ripped away from them at the last minute. ,36,TimOfAltona
1733,Oh that's right - because a vote for Andrew Hastie IS a vote for Malcolm Turnbull who is running 3 times more popular in the polls than their own leader. ,31,TimOfAltona
1734,"You may be a bit confused - historically there is a 5% swing away from the government of the day in by elections - so this result is in keeping with that trend. It was looking like a 10+% swing only last week - a great result for the Libs, great result for Andrew and a magnificent result for the people of Canning.",63,TimOfAltona
1735,"Well, if that's the case, I'll be looking over at the opposition side of Parliament to see if I can spot their newly minted Member for Canning sitting up behind Shorten somewhere. ",33,TimOfAltona

1739,Naturally the Left wrote him off within the first 24 hrs of the 'coup' - motivated more by fear of what he may do to Labor's electoral chances than any damage they falsely accuse him inflicting on Australia in the future. ,42,TimOfAltona
1740,"Providing he can construct an effective front bench, he can start moving the country in the right direction and Labor can hop on board and enjoy the ride whilst they reform and rebuild their shattered party.  ",38,TimOfAltona
1741,"Unlikely to be a swing to the LNP - I know Turnbull is the messiah and all that, but don't think even he could conjure up a swing to the Libs when they already enjoy an 11% gap last election. ",41,TimOfAltona
1742,Look at all the carbon Turnbull has saved from going into the environment by not flying the RAAF PM jet over to Perth and back. Not to mention the savings the tax payer. ,34,TimOfAltona
1743,"He has only been PM for 5 minutes and we have not seen his cabinet yet, nor have we seen any policy discussion emanating from the same cabinet which is yet to be announced.  ",36,TimOfAltona
1744,"It reflects more on them than it does the target of their abuse, it means they have already lost the argument so have to resort to childish name calling to compensate - there is a psychological term for it which escapes me now.",43,TimOfAltona
1745,The childish and tricky wedge politics Labor played all week trying to target the new PM shows how far they have descended into nothing more than cheap slogans and gotcha moments instead of attempting to engage in constructive debate aimed at fleshing out a plan to take the country forward. ,51,TimOfAltona
1746,Labor tacticians need to take a hard long look at themselves over the 3 week break and get Shorten and his crew to pull their heads in on trying to constantly disrupt the parliament like recalcitrant school children and try entering into some adult debate with the government on key policy areas. ,53,TimOfAltona
1747,"Today it is a referendum on both Bill Shorten's leadership and how voters feel generally about the future of the Coalition government under Turnbull, a small snapshot but an interesting one. ",32,TimOfAltona
1748,No I think what he was referring to was the ALP slashed tens of millions of dollars out of the defence budget which had a negative flow on effect across the all 3 services plus the cadet movement. ,39,TimOfAltona
1749,So Shorten has gone from hoping Labor lose so as to keep Abbott in play to desperately needing a Labor win in Canning to keep his own survival in tact. ,31,TimOfAltona
1750,"Unfortunately, I can't give you my personal email for it would reveal too much information, but I will work out another way to contact you via that email you provided...maybe via a third party (all very cloak and dagger). ",40,TimOfAltona
1751,Despite his sometimes flawed prime ministership I would still like to see Tony Abbott return to a front bench position - perhaps in the second term of the Turnbull administration. ,31,TimOfAltona
1752,Not an expert on that but I seem to recall there was an 'out' clause somewhere along the lines that if a particular % of the party room vote against the leader he/she is gone. ,36,TimOfAltona
1753,"Seems everyone wants a piece of Malcolm and to get in his ear - unionists, feminists, asylum seekers in detention, media, business groups, environmentalists, renewable energy industry,ethnic minority groups, economists, charities and medical groups and that's only on his first day. ",42,TimOfAltona
1754,"I would not be too concerned Ebony, despite what Van Badham would have us believe about Malcolm - I think you will find he is the best friend gender equality groups have ever had in a PM. ",38,TimOfAltona
1755,This is not the main game in town right now and there is always finger pointing and accusations swirling around after a sitting PM is shown the door - ask Labor as they are past masters at this and highly probable that they will be going through the same thing again before Christmas. ,54,TimOfAltona
1756,Plibersek carries way too much baggage from the failed Gillard administration and was a founding member of the infamous Handbag Hit Squad attempting to but failing to pin a misogyny label on Abbott as a tactic to try and turn around Gillards unpopularity. ,44,TimOfAltona
1757,Malcolm Turnbull has been my pick ever since he was Opposition leader - it was all in the timing and thank god we now have Malcolm as our PM. ,30,TimOfAltona
1758,"Safe seat or not, if Labor are as good as you tell us each day and the LNP is as bad as you tell us each day then Labor should win easily.",32,TimOfAltona
1759,They haven't even shown that they are on the path to reform and rebuild - the best they can hope for is to thrash around in the political wilderness for years until they drop the delusion that an unpopular government is all they need to fall back over the line into government.,52,TimOfAltona
1760,"Actually you are wrong, this is only the start. Expecting Turnbull to change the world within his first 24 hrs as PM and before he even has his front bench in place is just a tiny bit unrealistic IMO . ",41,TimOfAltona
1761,The prognosis is looking very positive for the Turnbull administration as evidenced by early polling plus Canning result will be a further indication of the trajectory the government is on. ,31,TimOfAltona
1762,"If Labor are good enough ( and we see plenty of comments each day in these threads trumpeting how good Labor are) they will romp it home in Canning apparently because the electorate don't trust the LNP and want them out of government,again as seen each day in these threads. ",51,TimOfAltona
1763,So do we expect to see Bill Shorten standing up on the winners podium holding up the hand of the Labor candidate ( anyone know his/her name?) in victory come Saturday night? ,33,TimOfAltona
1764,"If Labor have been good enough in opposition and have presented the electorate with a credible set of policies and a leader who people want to see as our PM, they will romp it home and Shorten's leadership will be safe. ",42,TimOfAltona
1765,On the other hand if all the ALP have presented are negative wedge politics accompanied by an empty kit bag of ideas and policies along with a disaster of a leader then perhaps they won't taste sweet victory on Saturday?,40,TimOfAltona
1766,A tricky situation - if any of the lefties can advise the new PM on how he can bring those asylum seekers who are genuine refugees to Australia without starting up an armada of people smuggling boats and hundreds if not thousands of lives being lost at sea along the way I reckon you should sit down and have a chat with him.  ,65,TimOfAltona
1767,Speaking of knives - anyone know who's holding the key to the Labor party room cutlery draw. Did Bill manage to hide it or did Albo take control of it?,30,TimOfAltona
1768,"Who mentioned QT, not me. I'm talking about Labors pressers next week where they will try with the good old wedge politics tactic - this is what needs to change otherwise all they will see is themselves falling further and further behind in the polls.",45,TimOfAltona
1769,Turnbull is right - Australians want better than that from their elected representatives and Labor are letting the country down thus ensuring they are destined to be stuck in opposition for quite a few years to come.,37,TimOfAltona
1770,"Labor seriously have to lift their game next week - sensing they are well and truly on the back foot, their childish tactics have been a shambles this week and has exposed them as nothing more than a lost party thrashing around in the political wilderness hoping and praying that if they throw enough mud at the new PM something may stick - unlikely though - Turnbull is too smart for them all and it shows. ",77,TimOfAltona
1771,Then we have to endure yet another knifing drama being played out but ultimate it s probably what Labor need to do if they are to have any hope in the 2019 election IMO.,34,TimOfAltona
1772,You see it wasn't about Abbott at all - it's all about the fact that Labor are no longer in government and it does not matter who the Liberal leader is - it's all about trying to get Labor back into government any way possible . ,47,TimOfAltona
1773,The biggest problem the cheer squad have is that their own party is pretty much unelectable for the myriad of reasons we know so well - suggest they start working out how they can reform Labor and try and get them into a position where they are at least competitive in 2016. ,53,TimOfAltona
1774,"Just focussing on Malcolm Turnbull is not enough to get Labor over the line, they need to step up and prove they have the ability to govern this country. ",30,TimOfAltona
1775,There is s very long way to go as you can see from this thread - 95% of comments are all about how 'bad'Malcolm Turnbull is whilst they ignore their own party going backwards big time. ,37,TimOfAltona
1776,On the European refugee crisis - I see Merkel tried to do a Kevin Rudd and look what's happened. She should have spoken to K Rudd first and got his feedback on the human disaster that follows opening up borders to all and sundry. ,45,TimOfAltona
1777,Their tactic to try and wedge Turnbull in the first couple of QT's has made Labor look they have nothing more to offer Australia than slogans and wedge politics. Failure. ,31,TimOfAltona
1778,Time for Shorten to show he can be a leader and ask responsible mature questions relevant to the future of the country and he may be surprised that he will receive sensible and direct answers. ,36,TimOfAltona
1779,Don't dismiss the potential for Tony to return to the front bench perhaps in the extremely likely second term of the Turnbull administration. He would make a fine Immigration minister or even perhaps Defence Minister given his high standing amongst Defence Department personnel IMO ,45,TimOfAltona
1780,"Fantastic news for the LNP, the swinging voters who were not sure about Abbott and the large number of disillusioned Labor voters waiting for Turnbull to take the leadership. ",30,TimOfAltona
1781,"Turnbull has a mammoth task ahead to calm the waters of a long time poisonous political environment, not helped by a Labor party increasingly concerned that 2016 is now beyond them. ",32,TimOfAltona
1782,"It's within the rules Bob. you don't like it speak to your local federal MP to have it changed. Plenty of pollies are doing that , Labor and Liberal and it's all within the rules. ",36,TimOfAltona
1783,Very funny situation emerging today in guardian threads - many of those who consistently called for Abbott to go are starting to change their tune and suggesting maybe he should have stayed after all. ,35,TimOfAltona
1784,"The realisation that the only assert in Labor's electoral kit bag was Tony Abbott and that has been cruelly ripped away from them, leaving them nothing but a lame duck leader and a dysfunctional party sitting behind him. ",39,TimOfAltona
1785,"Once the polls start showing the Coalition holding a winning 2PP lead and Turnbull consistently 30+ points ahead of Shorten as preferred PM, we await the 'polls are rigged' brigade to hit the Guardian threads.  ",37,TimOfAltona
1786,"Dean, the problem for you out of all this is that you ( and the ALP) have been left standing like a shag out on a rock with a leader who is unelectable.",33,TimOfAltona
1787,"The conundrum in which Van exists is that her party, the Greens, will never form government in this country, well not for the next 100 years or so perhaps. ",30,TimOfAltona
1788,The closest the Greens can come to being in government is through the ALP where they can pull a few strings in return for preference flows but this is where it all goes horribly wrong for Van and the Greens. ,41,TimOfAltona
1789,"The ALP were nearly decimated during the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd fiasco and since then not only have they failed to plan and implement much need reform to return them to electable status, they have gone and inserted an unelectable leader who has also taken the party so far to the right that many cant tell the difference between Labor and Liberal anymore. ",61,TimOfAltona
1790,"No wonder so many Labor voters have abandoned their party and hopped on board the Green train and now that Turnbull is leading the Liberals as PM, many will fall in behind his leadership to take the country forward - early polls already reflect that fact. ",47,TimOfAltona
1791,"It's very early days for Turnbull but the nation is counting on him to be around for a very long time to stop the revolving door politics of the past few years, bring stability to the government and the nation and deliver on the things we expect of our government - governing for all people and not just a few. ",61,TimOfAltona
1792,Plenty of Labor voters are also keen on MT - they will see how he goes in the next few weeks with a view to switching their vote across to the Libs because they can't stand Shorten. The polls reflect that already.,42,TimOfAltona
1793,I feel your pain though when events of the past 48 hrs have wiped out any slim hope you had of your beloved ALP getting back into government in the next 7 years or more.,35,TimOfAltona
1794,Impressive responses from the PM to Labor's obvious stunt questions - Labor think they are being tricky or smart with their line of questioning - all it's doing is confirming in people's minds why Labor have little prospect of forming government in this country IMHO.,45,TimOfAltona
1795,By that you mean Labor has to have the support of the Greens to survive - no wonder the last Labor government is referred to as a Labor/Greens government. ,30,TimOfAltona
1796,He has only been in the role less than 24 hrs and you have already written him off as someone you hate...pretty much shows how disingenuous your comment is. ,30,TimOfAltona
1797,Master stroke by Turnbull to both renew the coalition agreement between the Nats and the Libs and also put water back into the agriculture portfolio where logically it used to be. ,32,TimOfAltona
1798,Come clean with the Australian people - you would hate  in the Liberal leadership role....suck it up princess....Turnbull is here for the long term and by that I mean two more terms at least.,35,TimOfAltona
1799,You Labor cheersquadders are a cynical bunch - just because the Labor party indulged in that type of behaviour does not auto translate to the Liberal party copying Labor's failures. ,31,TimOfAltona
1800,"I think your worst fears have been realised, Abbott is gone and we now have a PM the whole country can get behind to take the nation forward.  ",30,TimOfAltona
1801,"If the polls are anything to go by, it seems plenty of Labor voters prefer Turnbull as PM than Shorten. In fact, more than plenty, a significant number of Labor voters. ",32,TimOfAltona
1802,"The Labor cheer squad need to get their story straight, half of them were claiming this morning that Shorten got rid of Abbott, now you claim it was Turnbull who got rid of Abbott. Which one is it to be?",40,TimOfAltona
1803,"David, it must be so sad that you've had the rug pulled out from under your feet with the ascension of Malcolm Turnbull...don't worry you are not alone, most of the ALP are feeling the same way today. ",39,TimOfAltona
1804,As a 'self confessed' former Liberal voter you may want to give Malcolm a go to see if he can deliver on our expectations before you start canning him? ,30,TimOfAltona
1805,Do they still hang around with their silly Abbott images in their profile or do we expect they will now transform their online profile to start a crusade against Malcolm Turnbull? ,32,TimOfAltona
1806,"Bill Shorten and the ALP will no longer be able to sit back, do nothing and think all they have to do to win government is 'be there'  ",30,TimOfAltona
1807,"All eyes will be on Turnbull and if he can deliver on what it is we all want to see from our government, Shorten will have to be replaced before Christmas. ",32,TimOfAltona
1808,This afternoon Turnbull had the numbers - I doubt they will change the other way between then and now and for the sake of everyone it would have been good for Abbott to resign his commission and make a clean bloodless transition to a new PM.  ,48,TimOfAltona
1809,"The theory is that as they have such small numbers in the lower house, making a noise makes it look like there are more of them than there actually are! ",31,TimOfAltona
1810,Yet he consistently polls as the nation's preferred PM - head and shoulders above anything Labor can put up - perhaps you are right and the rest of Australia are wrong? ,32,TimOfAltona
1811,"We know happened, or didn't happen, when Labor were running things - not too flash as it turned out, but it'll be up to Turnbull to sell what the current government have achieved thus far.",35,TimOfAltona
1812,Shorten and the ALP strategists are in for an uncomfortable few weeks for they know only too well that if Abbott goes then Shorten and the ALP are finished ( for 2016 at least) and will probably lead to yet another knife fest down at 'Team Labor'. ,48,TimOfAltona
1813,"Worth pointing out that Labor under Shorten are in such a weak position that their entire 2016 campaign is not only dependant on Labor losing the Canning by election, but losing without a major swing away from the Libs. ",40,TimOfAltona
1814,"With everyone commenting in Guardian threads who are fixated on polls and claiming the moral high ground because the polls back them up, it's worth pointing out that the same polls have for over two years consistently returned one individual as head and shoulders above everyone else as the clear favourite for PM. ",54,TimOfAltona
1815,"That said, I have read countless times that this by election is a referendum on Tony Abbott's leadership of the Liberal Party and as PM so I'm guessing that if that's the case, everyone in these threads should be saying Hastie has no hope in hell? ",47,TimOfAltona
1816,"Yes, they are not perfect and yes, the sooner the offshore detention centres are emptied and closed the better, however countless lives have been saved as a result of Operation Sovereign Borders. ",33,TimOfAltona
1817,"Funny thing about all this Katharine is that in the view of many or perhaps most who congregate in the Guardian, you as a senior political journo, carry the heavy weight of expectation and responsibility to be actively pro-'left' and  that smacks of being even moderately critical of the ALP or Greens or their respective leadership tends to draw the wrath of those 'affectionately' termed the Labor/Greens cheer squad.  ",72,TimOfAltona
1818,"Should you ever, heaven forbid, report or commentate on anything  positive about the LNP or it's policies and particularly the PM, well that just falls into the high treason category and punishment is by way of a sharp personal rebuke and even threats of 'never reading the Guardian again' after a piece the other day (not by you) seemingly praising the Abbott government on it's intake of 12,000 Syrian refugees.  ",73,TimOfAltona
1819,Seems to me that a big chunk of the Labor/Greens cheer squad enjoy logging onto the Guardian Australia edition each day to receive their daily dose of anti-Abbott/anti-LNP reporting and woe betide any Guardian journo who dares not to conform with that expectation. ,44,TimOfAltona
1820,Vanessa looks to be a pretty good candidate for the Greens and good work by the Guardian to feature another candidate rather than focus each day on the Liberal candidate. ,31,TimOfAltona
1821,"As good as she may be, it must be a little disheartening as a candidate to know that you stand almost zero chance of getting up on the day, particularly in Canning. ",33,TimOfAltona
1822,The experience will be good for her though and if she's really that good Vanessa could be parachuted into another seat where she stands a better chance in the 2016 federal election.,32,TimOfAltona
1823,"Kudos to the Guardian for giving Andrew enormous publicity leading up to the election......however it could be a wasted effort......Liberal voters in Canning are unlikely to have heard about the Guardian, let alone read it.  ",37,TimOfAltona
1824,Not the worst interview we've seen from Abbott and certainly not the best - but he did make some valid points relevant to progress the government is making in key areas. ,32,TimOfAltona
1825,Difference is Abbott runs or cycles at 5.30am each day and the other difference is Shorten looks ridiculous in that get up - check out the pastie white legs. LOL.,30,TimOfAltona
1826,"We wait with much anticipation for Sarah Hanson-Young to hold a press conference to congratulate the government on it's decision to grant 12,000 Syrian refugees permanent residency in Australia, over and above the current UNHCR quota. ",37,TimOfAltona
1827,"Instead of congratulating the government on laying the foundation for bringing in 12,000 (2000 more than Labor nominated) mainly Syrian refugees, it's all about denouncing Abbott and being critical of his decision labelling it a stunt. ",37,TimOfAltona
1828,The Abbott government could deposit ten million dollars into your bank account and you would accuse him of buying votes and you would send the money back rather than vote LNP such is your one-eyed view on the world.,39,TimOfAltona
1829,"Speaking of the Greens, where is Sarah Hanson-Young holding a presser to congratulate the government on accepting 12,000 Syrian refugees permanent residency over and above the current UNHCR quota? ",30,TimOfAltona
1830,"Bull Shorten making feeble attempts to take the credit for the PM's pending announcement to take in 13,000 Syrian refugees and give them permanent residency - gee that's 3,000 more than Labor proposed Bull. ",35,TimOfAltona
1831,Given the fate of other Arab dictators you would expect Assad will have a carefully planned exit strategy which involves asylum in a 'friendly' nation along with billions of dollars safely hidden away in Swiss bank accounts. ,38,TimOfAltona
1832,Abetz's comments are not without foundation. You can only take in so many images of headless children lying side by side on the ground like sardines after IS murderers have rampaged through their christian community to know that these people are indeed in need refuge.,45,TimOfAltona
1833,"Try as they did, it is good to see the ACTU and their CFMEU branch unable to bully the Australian Senate into looking the other way on corruption and criminality by disbanding the inquiry into dodgy unions. ",38,TimOfAltona
1834,"The number of Syrian refugees this country needs to take is increasing as each day passes - labor opened the bidding at 10,000 now Wilkie has upped the ante to 30,000, tomorrow Sarah Hanson Young will be calling for 500,000 be immediately resettled in Australia. ",46,TimOfAltona
1835,You can easily see why Mike Baird is the most popular senior politician at a state level whilst Malcolm Turnbull is the most popular senior politician federally - according to opinion polls which so many hang their hats on as the key indicator of electoral success.,46,TimOfAltona
1836,Portraying Australia as some kind of evil empire with closed borders is mischievous and inaccurate. Australia has one of the largest refugee intakes in the world and will probably do more with this latest Syrian crisis. ,37,TimOfAltona
1837,"Factcheck - Austria are not offering residency to the migrants arriving from Hungary, they are merely transporting/escorting them out if the country as quickly as possible and dumping them in Bavaria for Germany to sort out. In fact there are reports that Austria, like Hungary, are about to now close its borders to stem the tide of mass uncontrolled migration. ",61,TimOfAltona
1838,"Factcheck - The government's stop the boats policy has worked and has very likely prevented hundreds of distressing situations like the Syrian boy washed up on the Bodrum beach last week. The dark days of the last Labor government saw over a thousand men, women and children drown in the waters north of Australia and why were they never named and personalised like the boy last week? Where were the Greens denouncing maritime people smugglers and calling on people not to board boats and head to Australia? ",88,TimOfAltona
1839,"Factcheck - the government paid the crews on a couple of boats to return their passengers to the safety of Indonesia, not to their country of origin. These people are perfectly safe in Indonesia whilst they await processing through the UNHCR. They are not fleeing the threat of death in Indonesia. ",52,TimOfAltona
1840,"Factcheck - the number of children in detention has significantly reduced since the dark days of the last Labor government. The government are working to empty the offshore facilities, opened by Labor and overflowing because they lost control of the borders. There have been reported cases of abuse which is unacceptable and the sooner the centres are closed the better. If the government were to relax the rules around families or unaccompanied children arriving by boat , refer to factcheck on drownings above. ",84,TimOfAltona
1841,"Factcheck - Australia targeting IS positions in Syria will not lead to an improvement in the polls for Abbott. Claiming Abbott pressured the U.S. to invite Australia is nothing more than leftist rhetoric. Obama called Abbott from Airforce One to discuss the Trans Pacific Partnership and the topic of IS and Syria arose. U.S. Military officials subsequently contacted their Australian counterparts and it went from there. In case any of the Labor/Greens cheer squad don't like what the U.S. are doing in IS held territory in Syria hop onto Liveleak and take a look at what IS are doing to men, women and children from mainly non-Sunni communities - no wonder these people are fleeing. You may change your mind about Australia assisting with the effort to destroy IS. ",130,TimOfAltona
1842,"Factcheck - Australia can and very likely will do more to assist within our capabilities, but there is limit to how many people we can accommodate - 10, 20 or even 30 thousand is a tiny fraction of those seeking resettlement, there are millions behind them. The solution has to be resolving the situation in their home countries so they can return - stopping IS is a prerequisite of that.",70,TimOfAltona
1843,"You maybe right,but reality is Di Natale will never ever be PM or even run for PM.....its LNP or Labor. You need to make the most out of those two.",30,TimOfAltona
1844,"Labor have been caught out going in half cocked with a number of 10,000 pulled out of their arse thinking they can wedge the government ahead of anything Dutton comes back with from UNHCR talks in Geneva and Paris. ",40,TimOfAltona
1845,"Clearly a recalcitrant senate made up of a colourlful mix of washed out union hacks, kangaroo poo throwers, bogan Tasmanians and an eclectic array of people getting in with a tiny fraction of the vote courtesy of the Preference Whisperer has made good governing a tad challenging. ",48,TimOfAltona
1846,"Once again the Greens are proposing the solution to halt the genocidal march of ISIS is to join them around a campfire in the desert and whilst holding hands everyone sings Kumbaya and everything will be resolved and all will happily ever after - well sure beats the shit out of bombing ISIS, but I doubt the Greens strategy will work too well in this case.",66,TimOfAltona
1847,"I'm confused - all weekend the Labor/Greens cheer squad have been attacking the government for perceived inaction on the refugee situation in Europe and today when it's announced Dutton is headed to Geneva to meet with UNHCR officials on Australia's potential contribution, they are all attacking him for going over there to meet with the UNHCR? ",57,TimOfAltona
1848,In case you haven't noticed Daisy - no speech or comment from anyone in Labor or the ACTU is complete without 100+ mentions of the name ' Tony Abbott' in the one sentence. ,34,TimOfAltona
1849,"Why do you get the strong impression that Abbott could announce Australia are taking 200,000 Syrians next week and the Labor/Greens cheer squad would either attack him as heartless and immoral for not taking 500,000 or attack him saying it is nothing more than some kind of pre-election ploy designed to shore up his leadership. ",56,TimOfAltona
1850,"In other words it matters not what he says or does, these clowns will never be happy until their CFMEU puppet is in The Lodge. Just the way it is.",30,TimOfAltona
1851,"I'm with you, get rid of the Abbott government and the following week Daesh will surrender and disband, Sunni and Shia will live side by side in harmony in Iraq and Syria, all the refugees in Europe will return to their homeland and rebuild their lives and all the economic migrants flooding in to Europe from the African continent will return home. ",63,TimOfAltona
1852,It is a real shame so many of the Labor/Greens cheer squad seem more than happy to let Daesh continue their genocidal march through Syria and Iraq. The atrocities they are committing are beyond comprehension and it reminds me of that old saying that goes something along the lines that 'Evil flourishes while good men do nothing'. ,58,TimOfAltona
1853,"If any of the Labor/Greens cheer squad don't understand that what it is we are trying to stop here suggest if you are brave enough go into Liveleak and see the images of what Daesh are doing to mainly Shia and Christian women and children, not to mention captured soldiers or anyone they consider not with them. ",58,TimOfAltona
1854,I'm sure the good burghers of Canning are not about to change their vote to the LNP because Abbott is looking to assist the U.S. in the Syrian theatre. ,30,TimOfAltona
1855,"Significant factors have to be considered - intelligence around targets, crew recovery if any RAAF aircraft come down plus importantly ensuring as much as possible no civilians are targeted. ",30,TimOfAltona
1856,"Ultimately though, only so much can be achieved from the air. The only real way to shut down Daesh is put troops on the ground and clear them out of the towns and villages they have committed the atrocities in when capturing them and forcing people to flee.",48,TimOfAltona
1857,Last I looked the ALP and by default the CFMEU were backing the government on Iraq and Syria - why do you only want to single out the government? ,30,TimOfAltona
1858,It is considerably more precise than that - intelligence from the ground plus extensive use of drones to identify and pinpoint enemy targets has been very effective - it is not as you are attempting to portray a matter of just flying over the border and dumping bombs on any group of people they spot from 3 kms up in the air.,62,TimOfAltona
1859,Important to ensure necessary contingency plans are in place to rescue any RAAF crews in the highly unlikely event they come down in enemy territory - looks like the U.S. and any other Middle Eastern airforces currently operating on the Syrian theatre will have this key element covered. ,49,TimOfAltona
1860,I suspect the only ones reading this are the same ones who were calling for 'election now!' at roughly 9pm on Sept 7th 2013 - just after Abbott's victory speech.,30,TimOfAltona
1861,"Pretty clear the Labor/Greens cheer squad have realised their leftie candidates ( who no one even really knows their names) are out in the cold and headed for defeat in Canning, so all that's left is the usual grubby remarks to make up for yet another Labor/Greens loss IMHO.",49,TimOfAltona
1862,The Labor/Greens cheer squad seem to like to talk a lot about Hastie as well whilst ignoring their own candidates - does anyone even know the names of the Labor and Greens candidates?,33,TimOfAltona
1863,"Ah the Andrews government getting itself into a spot of bother I see.....let's see how the messiah Andrews steers the creaking/leaking Victorian Labor ship through this one - so far it's the usual denial,denial,denial.",34,TimOfAltona
1864,"There have been hundreds of articles about Shorten being inept, faceless, puppet of unions, assassin of two sitting Labor PMs, unelectable, boring, zinger-king, under performer etc etc....and you think this is the first and only negative story about him? ",40,TimOfAltona
1865,"There is an organisation called ISIS, you may have heard of them, but you make no mention of them at all in your attack on Abbott. They are a radical Muslim 'cult' who are rampaging through Iraq and Syria and engaging in genocide ( that means the rape and murder of thousands of men, women and children) who are largely of non-Sunni origin. ",64,TimOfAltona
1866,"In your zeal to attack Abbott, you seem completely oblivious to the evils of ISIS and are trying to blame Tony Abbott for the murders and exodus from Syria to Europe. ",32,TimOfAltona
1867,His 'crime' in their clouded eyes is that he is a Liberal candidate and therefore worthy of demeaning and offensive comments irrespective of who he is. I guess it's easier for the author of the offensive comments to do this when he hides behind a veil of anonymity. Bordering on cowardly IMHO.,52,TimOfAltona
1868,"Labor have such a weak and insipid leader, not only massively unpopular with the Australian electorate but also within his own party (Labor Left), that his whole political future and that of the ALP is riding on the outcome of the Canning by-election. ",44,TimOfAltona
1869,What has become of the once great Labor Party that they have to resort to pushing a Liberal candidate to ensure he wins over some poor Labor schmuck that no-one knows his name and put up to lose the by-election to protect Shorten. ,44,TimOfAltona
1870,Why is it that in their eyes the left are the only ones entitled to take to the streets and protest while those with opposing views have no entitlement whatsoever and should be shut down or gagged? ,38,TimOfAltona
1871,This has nothing to do with the PM - these pro and anti-mosque demos have been going on for ages - all through the Labor government years as well. ,30,TimOfAltona
1872,Labor trashed the defence budget when they were in power to help pay for some of their socialist policies - I think we all know who the defence force personnel want in government in this country and here's a tip - it ain't the Labor party that's for certain.,49,TimOfAltona
1873,Very sad it has come to this - the political party formed to protect workers rights are now campaigning to have workers rights trashed by desperately attempting to cover up corruption and criminality in the union movement which may be exposed via a Royal Commission. ,46,TimOfAltona
1874,I know which party I'd be voting for to protect my best interests if I was a low paid union member - not the one headed up the man who has the most to lose if the commission continues its work.,41,TimOfAltona
1875,"Ironic isn't it, that it is the LNP standing up for the rights and protections for low paid union members because the ALP have abandoned them in favour of protecting their ACTU overlords from damaging revelations emerging from the TURC.  ",42,TimOfAltona
1876,It seems the ALP are desperate to shut this down before any more union officials are locked up and don't forget there is still the unresolved issue of Bill Shorten and what he got up to as secretary of the AWU - plenty more coming down the pipeline at Shorten if the commission were to continue.,56,TimOfAltona
1877,ABC ran a poll on the day the decision came down - I recall the results were something like 60% agreed with Heydons decision to stay on and 40% against.,30,TimOfAltona
1878,I don't get why the Labor/Greens cheer squad are attacking the Liberal candidate because he is a former Australian soldier. I thought Australians respected their ex-servicemen and women who have returned from war zones - or do lefties not participate in that part of Australian culture? Best Shorten stay away from any ANZAC day ceremonies if that's the case.,59,TimOfAltona
1879,"Well, The Guardian are certainly promoting this candidate - pretty much everyone in Australia knows who the Liberal candidate for Canning is - anyone got any ideas who the ALP candidate is? Nothing about him/her anywhere. Anyone know his/her name? Do they exist?",43,TimOfAltona
1880,"Your comment suggests that they should fly to Indonesia, where they are safe, and then pay people smugglers to put them on dangerous boats to try and sail to Australia? ",31,TimOfAltona
1881,Funny how two people can watch the exact same program and come to completely opposing opinions on what they saw occur - is 'bias' the correct term or is 'blinkered' more appropriate? ,33,TimOfAltona
1882,Says the woman who lives in a country that has zero problems with tens of thousands of people trying to reach their shores by people smuggling boats and thousands drowning along the way. ,34,TimOfAltona
1883,"That does not mean however that while they still exist, we are absolved from the responsibility of providing a safe and secure environment for people in offshore detention centres. ",30,TimOfAltona
1884,"The sooner the centres are emptied out and closed the happier everyone will be, even the Greens may give the government some kudos for achieving that. Let's hope it's not too far away.",33,TimOfAltona
1885,This is always the outcome when you stack the Q&amp;A panel with a bunch of lefties - their comments were highly predictable and could have been reported yesterday before they even appeared on the show - what are the ABC thinking?,41,TimOfAltona
1886,I'm even expecting Shorten to just fall short of endorsing Hastie as the best person to represent Canning - he is cactus if Abbott is replaced due to Labor winning Canning.,31,TimOfAltona
1887,"Good interview with Dutton on 7.30 tonight. It's good to hear some common sense cut through the confected and hysterical rants of Dave Oliver, Mark Dreyfus and others who have a major interest in shutting down the commission.  ",40,TimOfAltona
1888,Australians can see what Labor and the unions are trying to do here and will welcome the decision by Heydon to stare them down and continue his work to clean up the union movement by exposing the crooks and corrupt behaviour endemic in some unions. ,46,TimOfAltona
1889,If Shorten gets caught up in it through his AWU dealings then so be it but if he has nothing to hide he won't object to reappearing in the witness box. ,32,TimOfAltona
1890,"You may not realise it but a number of state police forces have changed their uniforms to black - SA have, Victoria have, NT have, Federal police have - this is nothing new nor sinister .",36,TimOfAltona
1891,"Not a bad idea, you have to remember that ABF is a very new, very large organisation and as with any large organisational change some teething problems will occur. ",30,TimOfAltona
1892,Unfortunately this poorly worded statement stirred up the anarchists of the Socialist Alliance intent on destroying any kind of government authority and then the Labor/Greens cheer squad chimed in sensing it was another opportunity to attack the LNP government. Soon the whole thing got out of control fuelled of course by the usual anti-Abbott suspects frequenting Guardian threads. ,59,TimOfAltona
1893,"This can only be achieved by stopping the boats - the government, supported by the Labor opposition, have been successful with this policy and in time the centre will be closed as they were under the Howard government.",38,TimOfAltona
1894,Spot on. There are no tragic consequences for migrants staying in Indonesia - the tragic consequences start when they get on leaky people smuggler boats and try to reach Australia.,30,TimOfAltona
1895,The usual pro-refugee 'open up them borders ' activists like Sarah HY as deputy chair and a Labor ex-union stooge as chairman pretty much sums up the credibility of this report. ,32,TimOfAltona
1896,"4. If the committee recommends that children not be separated from their parents and parents must accompany their children to an as yet unspecified location, what impact will this decision have on people smugglers' business model? ",37,TimOfAltona
1897,5. How does the committee recommend the government deal with an influx of hundreds of people smuggling boats arriving each month carrying thousands of migrant families believing that parents with children will be given special treatment and settlement in Australia. ,41,TimOfAltona
1898,"6. What recommendations do the senate committee have to prevent the very likely hundreds or thousands of mass drownings occurring as a result of the maritime people smugglers business model being kick started, based on the notion that for those trying to circumvent the official UNHCR intake program, children are the key to acceptance and resettlement on mainland Australia? ",60,TimOfAltona
1899,"None of these valid questions absolve the Nauruan or Australian authorities from their duty of care in ensuring not only minors but everyone in offshore processing facilities are housed in a safe and secure environment whilst their claims are processed and ultimately they return to their country of origin, if it is safe to do so, or they relocate to another country in the region who will accept them. ",70,TimOfAltona
1900,"Any departure from the current tough policy on border control will only see the boats start up again and as we see almost daily in the Mediterranean, there are terribly tragic consequences.",32,TimOfAltona
1901,By all accounts the 4 who have gone to Cambodia are being well looked after and can look forward to a new life there - this statement is more likely than not an unauthorised spokesperson expressing a personal view not necessarily supported by the Cambodian government - but makes for good headlines back in Oz.,55,TimOfAltona
1902,There will be a lot more behind this probably starting with the fact the person making the comment was not authorised to speak on behalf of the Cambodian Govt and may not be accurate. ,35,TimOfAltona
1903,"In the meantime Labor can have a bit of fun with it, but given their squalid and hopeless performance when it came to border security, they should be last ones throwing stones at this.",34,TimOfAltona
1904,The ALP and their union overlords want to be very careful here - this can come back and bite them very hard if they stuff this up - it's already shaping up that way. ,35,TimOfAltona
1905,Time to stop dwelling on this and look to how we can get the China Free Trade deal locked away before the ACTU and rogue unions stuff it all up for the rest of the country. ,37,TimOfAltona
1906,"Despite the unhinged drivel by many on the left that they are a private para-military force of the LNP, they are in fact an amalgamation of the former Customs and Immigration Depts. The name Border Force probably derived from the UK Border Force who have been around for years in the UK and do exactly the same job as their Australian counterparts. ",63,TimOfAltona
1907,As much as the lefties are calling for Border Force to be shut down I suspect we would soon have anarchy on our streets if they no longer existed ....... Or is that what the Labor/Greens/Socialist Alternative agitators seek?,39,TimOfAltona
1908,"In their often clouded minds it has gone from a poorly worded statement about a law enforcement cross agency operation to Nazi storm troopers marching down Swanston St stopping, interrogating and summarily executing people who fail to produce visas. ",40,TimOfAltona
1909,Some of the drummed up fanciful rhetoric around this is a good example of why the left wing loonies will always remain a minority grouping dangling on the fringes of Australian society - good thing too I say.,38,TimOfAltona
1910,My guess he's going - vital though that he hands over the reigns to another commissioner so the TURC can complete the job it set out to do - clean up the union movement in Australia and recommend prosecutions where applicable.,41,TimOfAltona
1911,These anti-mosque protests have not just started up in the last 2 years - they have been going on for 10 years or more. You just want to use it to continue your usual anti-government rants.,36,TimOfAltona
1912,"The ABF and Dept of Immigration before them have been conducting raids and checking on visa status for years - in such places as workplaces, taxi ranks at airports in conjunction with police, road traffic authorities and sheriffs offices.",39,TimOfAltona
1913,Right here is where the question of credibility of comments in this thread is raised - where in any of this situation was it said that Muslims are being targeted? ,31,TimOfAltona
1914,"There is a reason for that. They know this is nothing more than a beat up from a poorly, perhaps unauthorised, comment from a Border Force official which has since been retracted. ",33,TimOfAltona
1915,The irony of that incident last Fri where a small group of Labor/Greens agitators gathered so quickly intent on blocking traffic in the Melbourne CBD is that a key contributor to their own unemployment are the tens of thousands of people working illegally and the ABF are the government agency responsible for locating and deporting. ,56,TimOfAltona
1916,"The hysterical and seemingly faux outrage emanating from the ALP and the Greens and their respective cheer squads over this incident are just that, hysterical and at times unhinged. ",30,TimOfAltona
1917,The lefties had us believing Nazi Storm troopers were marching down Swanston Street with a large Nazi swastika flag draped over the balcony of the Town Hall which was nothing more than a loose &amp; poorly worded comment from an Border Force official regarding a joint agency clamp down on crime in the Melbourne CDB and has since been retracted. ,61,TimOfAltona
1918,"Well, unfortunately for you it was your mob who placed all these children in detention. The current govt is working to empty and close down these off shore facilities which is the outcome we all want. ",37,TimOfAltona
1919,"Herein lies the problem for the Labor/Greens cheer squad - the people smugglers are hoping and praying for a return to a Labor/Greens government so they can start pushing people onto boats again and sending them off to Australia, along with the associated deaths at sea.",46,TimOfAltona
1920,"In many ways this is humorous - a cross agency law enforcement initiative in Melbourne involving police, sheriffs office, Vic Roads and Border Force has morphed, according to many of the comments below, into a Nazi military operation dragging people off to concentration camps or quietly executing them in the back of police vans up the back of the Botanical Gardens when no one is looking. ",67,TimOfAltona
1921,"Interestingly many of the Labor/Greens cheer squad, perhaps sensing this is something they can artificially inflate and try and pin on Abbott, have joined in with the wild fantasies of Nazi Germany storm troopers marching up the Bourke Street Mall and summarily executing grannies coming out of Myer who cannot produce identification papers. ",54,TimOfAltona
1922,It's all a load of leftist crap and little wonder Bill Shorten has distanced himself from the extreme left drivel emanating from some sections of his party and Labor supporter base attempting to link a Vic Police operation to the Federal government. ,43,TimOfAltona
1923,Gee thanks to Socialist Alternative all the people illegally in the country can breathe easy tonight - they are safe to stay on and take the jobs from Australian's in a shrinking labour market. Good one guys!,37,TimOfAltona
1924,The Labor/Greens squad have yet again got themselves all confused and in a muddle over this - they want to try and link the PM to a Victorian Police lead cross agency operation. Abbott would have had no knowledge of this yet the cheer squad have him patrolling the streets checking on people's immigration status. ,56,TimOfAltona
1925,"I'm with you - let's have no controls over our borders and allow anyone and everyone to flood into Australia anyway they can. Millions of people the world over can head this way and be looked after by the Australian tax payer. We will feed them, clothe them and provide them housing and jobs and we will all live happily ever after.",62,TimOfAltona
1926,Daisy here you go again - blaming any and every event that occurs in Australia on Tony Abbott. In your clouded mind he's walking the streets of Melbourne tonight on the look out for illegals. ,36,TimOfAltona
1927,"If I am in Australia illegally, either came in illegally or have overstayed my visa an are stopped by an Immigration official, how can I prevent that person finding out that I am here illegally and deporting me? ",39,TimOfAltona
1928,"Labor, the unions and their cheer squad were hoping they could get this shut down before Labor take an electoral hit and further erode any hope they have of winning government anytime soon. ",34,TimOfAltona
1929,"Shorten is already a major liability and it seems before the TURC can uncover more corruption and criminality in the union movement and perhaps the ALP itself, you can see why the ALP and their supporters have using the Heydon smokescreen to try and shut it down.",47,TimOfAltona
1930,You seem to have got yourself a bit confused over this - the film has not been censored nor has it been banned - it is available to anyone who chooses to watch it at any High school in NSW - just not in school hours.,46,TimOfAltona
1931,"Their are plenty of MPs on both sides of the House, plus I assume the Greens would also be for dumping the British Monarch from our constitution so let's get cracking. Once Abbott is gone there should be no excuses. Should Turnbull be our next PM (50/50 chance) he can deliver the nation the trifecta - ",57,TimOfAltona
1932,"1. Move the Libs back towards traditional centre right politics.(more centre than right) 2. Legislate for Same sex marriage3. Initiate legislation to turn Australia into a Republic - apart from anything else, think of the tens of millions saved on not having to maintain State Governers plus wearing the cost of Royal visits to Australia. They'll have to pay their own way if they want to come out here. ",70,TimOfAltona
1933,"Actually, it will be the quadrella because changing to a Republic means we also get to flick the Union Jack and change our national flag at the same time. ",30,TimOfAltona
1934,"Labor and the unions are only too happy to see it stopped in it's tracks to avoid too much electoral damage for them and their current leader, but Australians incl union members want to see this thing finished, have the union crooks exposed and hopefully charged and return some integrity to the union movement and by definition, the ALP who are largely controlled and therefore tainted by the union factions. ",71,TimOfAltona
1935,"Martin Ferguson, former head of the ACTU and Labor government minister, was spot on the other night about the unions having too much control over the Labor party and inserting many of their dead wood into the parliament either via the senate or safe labor seats in the lower house. ",51,TimOfAltona
1936,Interesting and intriguing situation this Canning by election. Interesting because none of the Labor cheer squad are calling it for Labor and intriguing because a Labor win may well hasten the departure of the PM which in turn means Shorten is also likely finished (as ALP leader) as well. ,50,TimOfAltona
1937,"What are the odds, Shorten and the ALP will be hoping for a resounding win to the Liberal candidate. They should be telling the Solar Council to pull their head in.",31,TimOfAltona
1938,"It would be good if Katharine's piece reminded us what happened when Labor were running the show - the cost blowouts and delays were so bad that Albanese 'misplaced' the NBN progress report ( he swore it was buried somewhere on his desk) so that it was not released during the election campaign. Well, we all found out why after the election didn't we? Gross mismanagement of Australia's largest infrastructure project by Labor - that's why.",76,TimOfAltona
1939,Unfortunately he's still enamoured by the failed Julia Gillard. He should have had the guts to stay the course and contest his seat at the 2013 election - instead he saw what was coming and jumped ship before his electorate tossed him aside.,43,TimOfAltona
1940,"The Labor cheer squad shouldn't get so excited just yet - last night's on ABC 4 Corners pretty much summed up the situation - If the ALP had a half used toilet roll as their leader it would still be ahead in the polls given Abbott's current unpopularity. Nothing to do with Shorten at all, in fact most people don't trust him nor like him. ",66,TimOfAltona
1941,"The election is still over a year away and many things can happen between now and then - a change of Liberal leadership is but one option that will see Shorten easily defeated at the election, provided he can hold onto the leadership till then.  ",47,TimOfAltona
1942,"Labor should learn from this experience and heed Martin's advice on party reform - for far too long the unions have dumped their dead wood into their parliamentary wing and you can see the result of that today, particularly in the senate. ",43,TimOfAltona
1943,"Here I was thinking the 3 part The Killing Season was sufficient , but tonight's story provides the Libs with truck loads of material to use against Shorten and the ALP IMHO.",32,TimOfAltona
1944,Martin is the former leader of the ACTU - you don't get anyone better credentialed than him to tell it like it is in both the union movement and the ALP.  ,33,TimOfAltona
1945,"Speaking of Trades Hall - did you notice what a dump it was inside? Walls and staircases covered in vile graffiti , mural of Gough wearing bright red lipstick, whole place looks like a health hazard for people working there - someone should report it to the union.",48,TimOfAltona
1946,"Ah...the good old defence of shooting the messenger....well keep that up I say, because it only means that Labor will warm the opposition benches for a few more terms yet.",30,TimOfAltona
1947,Shorten is sweating on the Canning by election - the last thing he wants is a Labor victory - it might hasten a change of Liberal leadership and the end of Shortens political career.,34,TimOfAltona
1948,Good to see Martin Ferguson confirm what some of us knew and many suspected - the upper houses of both state and federal parliaments are littered with the dead wood of ex Union officials not up to the task of moving up the union hierarchy so they put them out to pasture in the ALP. ,56,TimOfAltona
1949,"By the looks of the current ALP opposition front bench, it may not just be the upper house with the ex-union dead wood. Plenty of 'em in the lower house too.",31,TimOfAltona
1950,"Well, Four Corners this evening leaves Australia in no doubt why the TURC should continue and the bullies of the union movement, particularly AWU and CFMEU have plenty lose if the commission continues but none more so than Shorten himself.....no wonder at all why the AWU have been trying to have this shut down behind a feigned smokescreen of alleged bias. Their golden boy has too much to lose if he takes to the witness box again.  ",79,TimOfAltona
1951,First thing the Labor cheer squad do is come in here and try and destroy the person who agrees that union corruption and thuggery should be exposed and cleaned out. ,31,TimOfAltona
1952,"Well, Four Corners this evening leaves Australia in no doubt why the TURC should continue and the bullies of the union movement, particularly AWU and CFMEU have plenty lose if the commission continues but none more so than Shorten himself.....no wonder at all why the AWU have been trying to have this shut down behind the smokescreen of alleged bias. Their golden boy has too much to lose if he takes to the witness box again. ",77,TimOfAltona
1953,I suspect tonight's Four Corners episode - - an expose into Bill Shorten and his links to the AWU and the ALP will refocus our resolve to keep the TURC operating and perhaps a return visit to the witness box by Shorten.  ,44,TimOfAltona
1954,'Budget Emergency' was purely opposition rhetoric to highlight the then Labor government's fiscal recklessness not helped along by Swanny declaring over and over in the House that the budget will be returned to surplus under the Gillard government - all bullshit as we now know. ,46,TimOfAltona
1955,"Also, the last panel is misleading - Black Monday share dive has nothing whatsoever to do with Hockey's speech - ask the Chinese - they started the global share market melt down today.",33,TimOfAltona
1956,"No they report it as they see it. If you thought  was bad enough reflection on Labor, wait until tonights episode on Shorten and the nefarious links between him, the unions and the ALP are exposed.",37,TimOfAltona
1957,Speaking of Shorten - must see viewing on ABC Four Corners tonight on the rise and fall of Bill Shorten inextricably linked to the rise and fall of the ALP and the union movement. ,35,TimOfAltona
1958,He has only spent the last decade or more volunteering up in remote Indigenous communities - which is pretty much more than any other Australian politician has ever done consistently and certainly never been done by any other Australian PM previously.  ,43,TimOfAltona
1959,Good to see an Australian PM take the time and effort to visit and pay respect to Mabo's grave. The ALP and their supporters don't like it because none of their PMs ever bothered to go up and pay respects now they've forever been beaten to to it by a conservative PM.  ,54,TimOfAltona
1960,GST increase is the appropriate way to deliver the extra funding the states are desperate to locate for health and education - even at 15% we are still way below most other 'developed' economies.,34,TimOfAltona
1961,A GST increase without broadening it to include fresh food and other currently exempt items is the obvious and fairer solution - moving it up to 15% is inevitable and more likely to occur under a conservative government - that said I think there would be a Labor premier of two who would agree to the increase if push comes to shove.,62,TimOfAltona
1962,"The collective millions of small boats from these countries who's crew dispose of their rubbish, including all the plastic by simply throwing it overboard are a major source of ocean contamination , on top of that the tonnes of plastic waste finding its way into rivers each day and eventually taken out to sea is another primary source.",58,TimOfAltona
1963,"Daisy, you and I both know Abbott has been going up and doing annual volunteer work in indigenous communities for well over a decade now - living in the community and working on construction of facilities - long before any cameras started following him because he eventually became the PM. ",51,TimOfAltona
1964,6 years of an inner city latte sipping chardonnay quaffing Labor/Greens government and what did they have to show for it when it came to improvement in indigenous affairs? ,30,TimOfAltona
1965,At least he is doing a shit load more than any Labor PM has ever done up in the top end. I suspect that is why you are so damning of it all - It highlights a glaring failure by Labor PMs.,42,TimOfAltona
1966,Pretty clear from the comments in this thread the Labor cheer squad can see the Libs have put a formidable candidate into this by election and likely to trounce the fairly weak Labor candidate who's name no one can quite remember. ,42,TimOfAltona
1967,"That aside, Andrew Hastie is indeed impressive and I can think of few other backbenchers, Liberal or Labor , who displays so much early potential to one day playing a senior role in Australian politics. ",36,TimOfAltona
1968,Shorten and Labor are getting very nervous about Canning...they desperately want a Labor loss...a win to Labor may just spell disaster for them with a knock on effect to end any aspirations they had of Shorten and Labor making it into government.  ,44,TimOfAltona
1969,There is no border between Iraq and Syria - Daesh have that entire area under their control and consider it their caliphate. The Syrian government have long abandoned that territory - the RAAF should go in and obliterate the ISIS scum.,41,TimOfAltona
1970,As opposition leader Latham was actually streets ahead of John Howard as preferred PM in the opinion polls at the time - despite that Howard went on and won the next election with an increased majority. ,37,TimOfAltona
1971,"For me one of the highlights of modern day Australian politics was the look on Julia Gillard's face when she was confronted by Latham, then a Channel 9 reporter for 60 Minutes, and questioned by him in the street during the Aug 2010 election campaign. ",46,TimOfAltona
1972,The irony was that Gillard and her Left faction had backed Latham into the Labor leadership to take on Howard and here he was now trying to publicly expose her hypocrisy on the eve of an election. ,38,TimOfAltona
1973,"Labor seem to have had all sorts of bother in selecting leaders in recent years, look at all the disasters that were Latham, Rudd, Gillard and now Shorten. They should have stuck with Kim Beazley.",35,TimOfAltona
1974,"As a result the people smugglers have been put out of business , thousands of lives have been saved that would otherwise have been lost to drowning in the ocean and an orderly refugee migration program is operating which allow genuine refugees the opportunity to be processed via the UNHCR and enter Australia legally as part of a government sanctioned intake per year.",63,TimOfAltona
1975,"I think you may be a bit confused over this. As much as you want it to be, it is not a Federal initiated tax, nor is it a Joe Hockey tax.  ",34,TimOfAltona
1976,GST is agreed upon by state governments- in this case every Labor and Liberal state government agreed to this revision of the GST as it applies to overseas purchases of goods under $1000 - creates a level playing field with locally supplied goods. ,44,TimOfAltona
1977,Last time I looked - the Liberals were in government in NSW with the most popular Premier in Australia and look like staying there for another decade or so. ,30,TimOfAltona
1978,"The Unions throw up too many barriers in a police investigation in order to hide corruption/criminality, exactly why a RC is necessary to gather the evidence and if necessary submit to the DOP for charges to be laid against individuals. ",41,TimOfAltona
1979,You keep thinking that way comrade and then don't be surprised when Labor are rejected yet again next year over issues you have no idea about because you only immerse yourself in leftist media.,34,TimOfAltona
1980,Anyone would think Labor supporters are oblivious to the fact that if the commission continues and their leader is returned to the witness box it may have dire consequences for both his leadership and the ALP plus their union masters. ,41,TimOfAltona
1981,Errrr..... I think you'll find Labor did all that damage to themselves during the R/G/R era.......didn't need any assistance from the media other than to report on what was going on in ALP ranks.......and it wasn't pretty.,37,TimOfAltona
1982,No he's not. The only backlash is coming from the unions who only represent a tiny portion of Australian workers plus the ALP who have nothing to gain but plenty to lose if the commission continues and their leader has to return to the witness box. ,47,TimOfAltona
1983,There was some interesting content on Sky last week about what's coming down the pipeline at Shorten if he returns to the commission. You can well understand why the ALP are in all out attack here.,36,TimOfAltona
1984,More people in these threads should watch the content on Sky - plenty of engaging comment from both the left and right side of politics and helps with a more balanced view about political events. Plenty of Labor MPs line up to be interviewed each day and often directly in debate with their LNP counterparts - good viewing.,58,TimOfAltona
1985,You are not mainstream Australia - mainstream Australia are those who threw out the last Labor/Greens government and gave the LNP a massive majority in the lower house to form government. ,32,TimOfAltona
1986,Mainstream Australia are watching Labor and the unions make dicks of themselves by trying to shut down electorally damaging evidence emerging in a commission that they would never initiate themselves for fear of the outcome. Only an LNP government will root out corruption and criminality residing in the union movement and give members confidence they are not being ripped off.  ,62,TimOfAltona
1987,The Unions and their political party plus their often tawdry cheer squad want it shut down before it causes too much electoral damage and terminally wounds their ex AWU leader who is yet to front the commission for round 2 into alleged dodgy deals done to the detriment of union members. ,52,TimOfAltona
1988,"At any examination it is pretty clear what is going on here - if I were running things in the Libs I'd be running counter advertisements, questioning the motives behind unions and the ALP not wanting the commission to continue - then again they are doing a pretty good job of that themselves - their subterfuge is not going unnoticed by Australian voters. Good thing too.",66,TimOfAltona
1989,It's as clear as daylight why the ALP want this shut down - too much electoral damage and the last thing they want is Billy boy taking the witness stand again. ,32,TimOfAltona
1990,The QLD Labor government have in principle approved the new Adani dredging plan and have submitted it for both public comment followed by forwarding to the federal environment minister for consideration.. ,32,TimOfAltona
1991,Why are the Labor/Greens cheer squad attacking the federal government over what they might do when their own government has already seemingly approved The revised Adani plan and forwarded it on? ,32,TimOfAltona
1992,"Word has come down from the ACTU, they need to have the TURC stopped in its tracks. Our job today is to discredit the RC and it's Commissioner so we can get it closed down quick smart. We will sustain too much electoral damage if it is allowed to continue. Keep up the attacks on Dyson Heydon today by slinging as much mud as you can get away with and let's hope some of it sticks. Brendon, you take the lead again outside of Parliament and Tony Burke you do the honours in QT and whatever you do leave Bill right out of it. We simply can't afford another Williamson, Thomson or Jackson being exposed - this is our number 1 priority today comrades. ",125,TimOfAltona
1993,Labor and the ACTU are scrambling to have this shut down before any more damaging evidence is presented. Goodness only knows what's coming down the pipeline at Bill Shorten. ,30,TimOfAltona
1994,Let's all hope it does continue - only then we can all have confidence that the rogue unions have been exposed and union officials accused of corruption and other assorted criminality are charged. This level of protection for workers would only happen under an LNP government.,46,TimOfAltona
1995,Because 85% is  indignation from the Labor/Greens cheer squad. Many actually agree with some of the government's successful policies - they just want it to be a Labor/Greens government that is getting the credit.  ,37,TimOfAltona
1996,You definitely know the Labor/Greens cheer squad are losing the argument when all they have left are grubby attacks on physical appearances. Unfortunately too many of them engage in this childish behaviour on a daily basis. Poor form.,38,TimOfAltona
1997,Wrong.....only a RC can compel people to give evidence under oath. In any other situation including police interviews or courtroom evidence no one is compelled to say anything - exactly the reason why these corrupt union officials have got away with their criminality for so long ...no-one co-operates with the police and go to great lengths to disrupt or block a police investigation. Only a RC has the power to get to the bottom of serious allegations- which is precisely why Labor and the ACTU want this shut down and shut down quickly.,93,TimOfAltona
1998,"Why? Just to try and ""win"", to protect a tainted and corrupted union movement for political benefit (and to hell with the members or the law of the land), a venal and childish act but increasingly commonplace for this Labor Opposition and it's mindless adherents. ",46,TimOfAltona
1999,"It would be refreshing to see a Labor cheer squad member or  from the ALP say that while it would be good that Heydon stands aside, it is essential the commission continues it's work to identify and weed out institutionalised corruption within specific unions.  ",47,TimOfAltona
2000,Funny how we never hear that...it's all about shutting the TURC down and shutting it down quickly before anymore incriminating evidence is placed on the public record that could damage Labor's chances at an election. ,36,TimOfAltona
2001,I feel sorry for those union members who place their faith in the unions and the Labor party to protect their best interests - they should vote Liberal next election.,30,TimOfAltona
2002,"Gee, Labor are going all out to shut this RC down before anymore damaging evidence is forthcoming. There must be plenty coming down the pipeline they want hidden from voters. ",31,TimOfAltona
2003,"Who would have thought - a conservative government is standing up for the rights and protection of low paid union members whilst a Labor Party are stomping all over the lowest paid members by building a very high fence around alleged corruption and criminality occurring within the union movement, not to mention alleged dodgy deals done by the current leader of the ALP when he was a senior AWU executive (which are yet to be resolved one way or the other). ",82,TimOfAltona
2004,"If I were a worker in the health or hospitality or pretty much any sector you can think of, I know who I would be trusting to weed out both proven and alleged entrenched corruption and criminality in the union movement and here's a tip - it ain't the party currently running a protection racket for crooked unions.",58,TimOfAltona
2005,"We now look forward to your analysis on Australia's most popular politician - you know, the one who is more likely to be our next long term PM well ahead of Bill Shorten.",33,TimOfAltona
2006,Bill Shorten can only become PM with Greens preferences and the only way for the Greens to have a real voice and influence in the Lower House is if Labor are in government - this is why we refer to it as a Labor/Greens government.,45,TimOfAltona
2007,I read the piece over and over looking for reference to all the baggage Shorten brings with him to the ALP leadership - but alas Van has chosen to whitewash all the nasty stuff and do a puff piece on the unelectable Shorten.  ,45,TimOfAltona
2008,HaHa - award for the most humorous comment of the day. The knife cabinet has been unlocked and the ceremonial knife is being selected - let's hope it hasn't been blunted by all the previous use it has had in recent times.,42,TimOfAltona
2009,Labor were carrying on like primary school children once more...so much for Tony Burke asking that better behaviour prevail with the appointment of a new Speaker - Labor MP's were behaving like Bronwyn was still in the chair....Labor are full of crap. ,43,TimOfAltona
2010,"The sooner they get that they have to reform and actually do something about it, the closer they will come to getting back into government. So far, they've done nothing.",30,TimOfAltona
2011,"Where I sit there is only one viable candidate who fits the bill for that - you are spot on though, we need a leader who can unite and take the entire country with him/her.",35,TimOfAltona
2012,Why am I thinking this is one byelection Shorten and his strategist minders would be very happy to lose - even a Lib win with a large swing to the ALP could ultimately be devastating for Labor. ,38,TimOfAltona
2013,"Yes, I expect Labor will be going all out to win Canning, but when Shorten does start promising submarines for Canning I would be highly dubious - he has to win government first. Right here is where it gets very messy.",41,TimOfAltona
2014,"I have it on good authority Labor strategists are hoping and praying for Abbott to hold on as their internal polling reveals a change to Malcolm would be Shortens greatest nightmare - but we knew that already from the months of public polls showing Malcolm is the person the majority of Australians, Labor, Liberal and Green, would prefer as PM - miles ahead of any other.",66,TimOfAltona
2015,"Unless the Republicans can do better than offering up the casting from the Star Wars cantina scene as their field of Presidential candidates, Clinton is almost guaranteed a dream run to the Whitehouse.",33,TimOfAltona
2016,"I hear on the grapevine that Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd have a bit of time on their hands these days. They are 'well known' Labor identities, but for all the wrong reasons. ",34,TimOfAltona
2017,I doubt that 34 odd years ago neither Tony Abbott nor Dyson Heydon were conspiring to get Bill Shorten up in front of a RC into trade union corruption in the year 2015. ,34,TimOfAltona
2018,I'm with you - we must work hard to keep this trade union corruption and other assorted criminal behaviours hidden incase it goes on to damage the ALPs election prospects. ,31,TimOfAltona
2019,"The ACTU and their political division, the ALP, are scrambling all over each other to try and discredit the TURC for fear of what is coming down the pipeline at them and at any examination it does not look good for Labor's electoral prospects nor those of the the leader of their political arm.",54,TimOfAltona
2020,Drug addicted people destroying themselves and their families are not a partisan phenomena - they actually existed when Labor were in government too as hard as that is for you to accept. ,33,TimOfAltona
2021,Don't be so sure of that. Refer my comment below. Turnbull will have already worked out his new cabinet and I think we can pretty well guess who's in and who's out in order to move the government back towards ground currently occupied by Labor.,45,TimOfAltona
2022,The Labor/Greens cheer squad are joyous - they want Abbott gone and gone now. The consecutive polling results seemingly confirm that Abbott's tenure is looking terminal and the government would have a massive swing against it if an election were to be held today. ,45,TimOfAltona
2023,"Now let's turn our attention to the other consecutive polling result, the one none in this thread want to discuss or point out, the one that has been just as consistent over the past 18 months..........that Malcolm Turnbull (Australian Liberal Party) is the preferred PM across all voters , that includes Labor and Green voters for those who don't understand what 'across all voters ' means. ",67,TimOfAltona
2024,"So let's now consider a very real prospect in coming weeks - Liberal back benchers decide to back Turnbull which is increasingly likely and Turnbull, much to the relief of Australian voters is elected new party leader and therefore our new PM, with a mandate to turn around the government's fortunes in little over a year. ",57,TimOfAltona
2025,This is exactly the point where things get decidedly messy for the ALP. There is now a conservative PM vastly more popular than their own (conservative) leader and the polls will be reflecting that. Shortens leadership is unlikely to survive to the election if Turnbull is PM. ,48,TimOfAltona
2026,All Malcolm needs to do is move the government's agenda and policies back towards the centre......a cabinet reshuffle will be needed to achieve this.....and if he gets it right Labor are blown out of the water. ,37,TimOfAltona
2027,"So I say to all the Labor cheer squad calling on Abbott to go, careful what you wish for, it will likely lead to your party remaining on the Opposition benches for a couple more terms at least.",38,TimOfAltona
2028,In fact they and their cheer squad are sitting back hoping an unpopular government will allow them to sneak back into government without having to address the cancerous factional civil wars and leadership dysfunction which tore the party apart during the failed Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years. ,45,TimOfAltona
2029,By now attacking and trying to shut down the catalyst for reform they are leaving themselves open to public ridicule and further suspicion that the ALP have not learned the error of its ways and are therefore not fit to govern this country for a few terms yet.,48,TimOfAltona
2030,Gillard was a fraud who was found out and was so bad her own party were forced to knife her - it was your current leader Bill Shorten who did the honours in dispatching her - got in before the nation flicked her.  ,45,TimOfAltona
2031,"Jesus Dais, if Abbott had any more strong intelligent women around him I'd be getting worried...Julie Bishop, Sussan Ley, Peta Credlin, Margie Abbott, Frances Abbott, Louise abbott, Bridget Abbott, Karen Andrews, Michaelia Cash, Conchetta Fierravanti- Wells, Fiona Nash, Jelly O'Dwyer, Marise Payne the list goes on and on. ",49,TimOfAltona
2032,I hear they still have a cardboard cutout of Julia Gillard propped up against a wall at their meetings with a word bubble coming out of her mouth saying - ,31,TimOfAltona
2033,Plibersek is a lightweight when it comes to foreign affairs and security. Baffles me why she got this particular gig after Labor's hammering at the last election...no one else wanted it? ,32,TimOfAltona
2034,Never understood why Labor supporters are so fearsome of Peta Credlin - perhaps something to do with the fact that Labor have no-one of her strength and ability on their side.,31,TimOfAltona
2035,I agree with you. Malcolm's biggest challenge will be the front bench reshuffle. The party has to move back towards the middle and Malcolm's the man to achieve that providing he can weed out the hard right Liberal ministers' who will back Abbott to the hilt and are prepared to go down with Abbott if push comes to shove.,59,TimOfAltona
2036,"The Libs need to do some serious soul searching over the next 2 weeks and decide the best way forward. No question the backbenchers, along with those voters who actually take the trouble to follow politics are getting restless. ",40,TimOfAltona
2037,"From where I sit, there is really only one appropriate candidate should the numbers be there to make a move on Abbott - Malcolm has consistently lead in the opinion polls as preferred PM, streets ahead of Abbott and Shorten. ",41,TimOfAltona
2038,"The Labor/Greens cheer squad regularly refer to polling to support their assertion Tony Abbott is finished - can anyone get back to us as to which senior government minister the polls have consistently returned as the person the majority of Australians, Labor voters included, would prefer as Australian PM. ",50,TimOfAltona
2039,"No matter how many times the Labor cheer squad screech 'Time for an election' it changes absolutely nothing. The next federal election is over a year away and as they say a week is a long time in politics, so 12+ months is a lifetime. ",46,TimOfAltona
2040,I'm with you. We need a federal Labor government to come in and take back the naval shipbuilding projects so callously awarded to South Australia by the Abbott government and return them to Victoria where they rightly belong.,38,TimOfAltona
2041,"Right here is a prime example of why Labor are not in government - they stuffed up the roll out of the NBN. Mismanaged to the point they were sending the country broke. In the end it was a farce - Albo was hiding the true state of play from voters by hiding a report on his desk so it wouldn't be released before the election and when Turnbull came in we soon discovered why Albo had trouble 'locating' the report - Labor had totally misrepresented the true cost of their mismanage of the project. Billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule, perhaps decades. ",107,TimOfAltona
2042,What a load of sanctimonious crap from the Labor cheer squad. All everyone wants to talk about is the 'evil' Tony Abbott and the LNP government - no one is brave enough to discuss or even vaguely look in the direction of which party they propose is fit to replace the current government. ,54,TimOfAltona
2043,"Herein lies the problem for the anti-Abbott brigade - Labor are not up to the task of winning an election, particularly with Shorten as leader. Labor factions killed off the last Labor/Greens government in this country and very little has been done in the way of party reform.  ",50,TimOfAltona
2044,"As bad as the Labor cheer squad try and make Tony Abbott out to be, he can still win the next election and if they get their wish and he is replaced by Malcolm Turnbull before the election it's definitely goodbye Labor for another two terms at least.",48,TimOfAltona
2045,The problem with your assertion is that you assume that everyone in Australia has the same view as you on this subject and it is only the government holding an opposing position. ,33,TimOfAltona
2046,To be honest as it turned out an inanimate half used roll of toilet paper would have lead the ALP to a slender victory over the unpopular Campbell Newman - it was nothing Anna did or said that got her just falling over the line. ,46,TimOfAltona
2047,"It would be refreshing to see at least one Labor cheer squadmember acknowledge that there are criminal elements embedded in the union movement and that it is in everyone's interests, particularly hardworking low paid union members, that the corruption is exposed and those responsible brought to justice. ",48,TimOfAltona
2048,There was a very interesting price on Sky a few days ago about what's coming down the pipe for Bill Shorten from his AWU days which would not have gone unnoticed by the ALP. ,35,TimOfAltona
2049,"No, I suspect ISIS, much like the people smugglers, are hoping and praying for a Labor/Greens government to return and national security is relaxed once again so they can start up their deadly activity.",34,TimOfAltona
2050,You can see why Labor and its supporters are scrambling all over this &amp; want to see the TURC closed down - anything to avoid a spotlight on entrenched union criminality and associated thuggery endemic in certain unions with links to the ALP. ,44,TimOfAltona
2051,You have to ask the Labor cheer squad this question - can you trust a Labor government to investigate and eliminate entrenched criminality residing within the trade union movement or do we just accept that is part of the overall 'package' when a federal Labor government is in office? ,50,TimOfAltona
2052,Labor and their supporters will be found to be barking up the wrong tree over this - more information is surfacing which clarifies the all important timeline and related responses by Heydon and his office to this event. ,39,TimOfAltona
2053,Looking forward to Labor having to apologise to the commissioner and Bill Shorten back in the witness box to explain his involvement in dodgy union practices. An interesting piece on Sky the other night about what's coming down the pipeline for Shorten. ,43,TimOfAltona
2054,Funny thing - we were saying the exact same thing about Bill Shorten the other day...Labor should do all they can to keep the unelectable Bill Shorten in the role until the next election - worth a lot of seats to the LNP if he is still there.,48,TimOfAltona
2055,Fortunately voters don't buy this current smokescreen by the ALP designed to cover their tracks within the union movement. Crime and corruption within the union movement will be exposed despite Labor doing their utmost to keep it hidden.,38,TimOfAltona
2056,Could be a bit of confusion here - last I looked the LNP are not the accused at the RC. In fact no one is accused....that may come out later at the findings. ,34,TimOfAltona
2057,Your theory is predicated on the assumption that there is a viable alternative government waiting in the wings - this is precisely where your argument falls over and will see the current government returned - with or without Tony Abbott.,40,TimOfAltona
2058,Wouldn't it be ideal if the Guardian simply white washed any reports or news that could favour the government and only report on stuff that is either anti-LNP or pro-Labor/Greens. Now  a newspaper!,34,TimOfAltona
2059,Have not agreed with his comments at all. The point is he is significantly better informed about the situation on the ground in Syria than anyone commenting in this thread and his opinions should at least be respected given what he has seen and heard over the past couple of weeks.,51,TimOfAltona
2060,"Given Dan Tehan is the Chair of Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and just returned from a fact finding mission with intelligence agencies in the US, France and the UK he speaks with some authority on the situation on the ground in Syria and what is needed to assist curtail the advance of daesh in that country. ",60,TimOfAltona
2061,With all due respect to the Labor/Greens anti-government keyboard warriors in this thread sitting safely and comfortably at home or in your allocated cubicle at Trades Hall (whichever it may be) I suggest Dan Tehan has a much better insight into the complexities of Syria and Iraq than you. Just saying.,51,TimOfAltona
2062,"You may be a bit confused over this Dais - Dan Tehan is the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and has just returned from a fact finding mission to the USA, France and the UK meeting with senior military intelligence agencies in those countries regarding Syria and Iraq. His comments come from information he has been exposed to during the trip. ",67,TimOfAltona
2063,"Factor in the vast amount of sophisticated electronic exploratory monitoring equipment employed over the decades plus thousands of archeologists pouring over every mm of that tomb and its surroundings in the past 90 odd years, to proclaim a hidden doorway has only just now been 'discovered' right under everyone's noses sounds fanciful. ",53,TimOfAltona
2064,"I have been in that tomb several times over the years and let's face it, given the very small area of the burial chamber, it is highly implausible that a 'hidden' doorway purporting to lead to a much larger tomb has only just now come to light. ",48,TimOfAltona
2065,"In addition, knowing how things work in Egypt, only a hint would have been needed that such a doorway existed and the former corrupt Mubarak regime would have been probing &amp; cutting through the walls to get their hands on the much anticipated Nefertiti treasure years ago.",47,TimOfAltona
2066,"Strange why the 'experts' in Toulouse have not not publicly released anything that validates Najib's claim. Surely it is in everyones interests, foremost Najib's, to produce the evidence tracing this piece back to MH370?",34,TimOfAltona
2067,I see and as expected the Labor MPs keep pushing the boundaries with the new Speaker to see what they can get away with before being thrown out. Tony Smith is doing a pretty good job in dealing with this on Day 2 of his tenure.,46,TimOfAltona
2068,A small cabal of disaffected Labor/Greens supporters hovering around a Guardian thread do not a make up the majority of the public or for that matter even the 'public' - just so you know.,34,TimOfAltona
2069,Perhaps the government MPs on their turn for a question put a question to the Opposition on some of their policies (or lack of policies)...that would make QT a lot more interesting.,32,TimOfAltona
2070,This may come as a big surprise to the Labor/Greens cheer squad but there is a very large number of fellow Australians who agree with and support Abbott's positioning on this.  ,33,TimOfAltona
2071,He did an ok job on his very first day. No doubt he will grow into the role and be 'tested' by Labor along the way to see what they can and cannot get away with.,36,TimOfAltona
2072,Where are the howls of protests from the resident Labor/Greens cheer squad that the Labor government are evil and acting like Nazis for not doing enough for this endangered animal? ,31,TimOfAltona
2073,"I'm sure the Labor/Greens cheer squad will be forensically scouring the list of MPs expenses to see who can be the first to come up with something, anything, on Tony Smith. ",32,TimOfAltona
2074,"Largely because when push comes to shove, Labor are still on the nose after The Killing Season (best advertisement on why you should avoid the Labor Party) and voters will not risk returning an unreformed Labor party into government. ",40,TimOfAltona
2075,"Not at all. Given the Bronwyn Bishop saga sucked the oxygen out of everything else, I anticipated the result would have been a lot worse for the government. This is a good result at any examination when you factor in trends over recent months. ",45,TimOfAltona
2076,"The result tells us Tony Abbott is still not popular, Bill Shorten is still not popular and people nominate Labor for no other reason than a protest vote, not because Labor stands for anything in particular.",36,TimOfAltona
2077,Good to see the government has Labor and their cheer squad floundering around trying to guess who will be the new LNP Speaker. This is a good start for whoever gets the gig tomorrow. No point the PM broadcasting his preference ahead of the party room vote. This is the correct way to approach this transition to a new Speaker IMHO.,61,TimOfAltona
2078,"Players who infringe against an opponent are routinely booed in any AFL game.

2081,Don't believe them for a minute - wild horses won't keep them from tuning in - they need to so we can get the 500 odd confected comments Tuesday morning attacking anything or everything Josh Frydenburg utters on the program. ,41,TimOfAltona
2082,"Plenty of fair skinned, blonde haired, blue eyed AFL players have been subjected to regular booing for a period of time - from time to time it becomes fashionable to boo a particular player so crowds join in. ",39,TimOfAltona
2083,I ask this question- from now on if Adam Goodes infringes against an opposing player during play are the crowds permitted to boo or is he the only player in the AFL to be exempted? ,36,TimOfAltona
2084,The media will be swarming all over this match on the lookout for anyone in the crowd brave enough to actually boo at an AFL match whether Goodes is near the ball or not. ,35,TimOfAltona
2085,There are always going to be huge social and economic consequences with the uncontrolled migration of millions of people from different cultures having little or no money to support themselves turning up in 'wealthier' countries and expecting that country to support them. ,43,TimOfAltona
2086,"I'm with you. The sheer gaul of a PM actually travelling around his country to talk to people and announce government policies. No Australian PM has ever done this type of thing before, why should Abbott start now? It's just not right.",42,TimOfAltona
2087,I have always maintained that the majority of the Labor cheer squad are not really interested in the 'welfare' of those coming to Australia by people smuggler boats - it's all about not wanting a core policy that Abbott went to the last election with and won convincingly to succeed. ,51,TimOfAltona
2088,"Well without doubt the PM and the government have had the last laugh here - not only has the policy been a great success, Labor have now conceded they were wrong and are emulating the government's stop the boat policy.",40,TimOfAltona
2089,Actually they are being stopped - you are playing with semantics to try and bluff your way through the argument. What you really want to say is that a very small number of boats (compared to the thousands when Labor were in government) have not stopped  ,48,TimOfAltona

2091,"The article above makes no mention of the tens of thousands of men, women and children murdered by Daesh nor does it mention the tens of thousands of lives that will be lost if Daesh are allowed to continue their jihadist rampage through Syria and Iraq unchecked. ",48,TimOfAltona
2092,"Daesh, just like Hamas, embed themselves amongst civilian populations to both protect themselves and attempt to construct a propaganda victory should civilian casualties occur - broadcasting suspected or alleged civilian casualty numbers serves no purpose other than to play into the hands of the enemy and encourages continued use of civilians as human shields.

2093,Seems no one is brave enough to admit that their own party is hopeless and voters won't trust another Labor/Greens government until Labor sort out their internal dysfunction and leadership woes.  ,33,TimOfAltona
2094,"I'm with you. If you want true unbiased media coverage that tells the true story you can't go past Red Flag, that doyen of Australian socialist newspapers that will tell you only what you to read and obliterate any opposing opinion.  ",43,TimOfAltona
2095,First to go was Labor's belief that they need do nothing but sit back and cruise into government off the back of bad polling for the LNP - irrespective of how grossly unsuited their own leader was for the job. ,41,TimOfAltona
2096,"Now that that little myth has been exposed for what it is, a myth, we can get back to the real world which has Labor strategists worried, very worried indeed.  ",32,TimOfAltona
2097,Foreign investment is fine but there is a limit to how much and what we sell off before it becomes detrimental to the long term interests of the nation. Residential housing is the same.,34,TimOfAltona
2098,"Funny how Newspoll , that long time nemesis of the Labor/Greens cheer squad who routinely declared it 'rigged' and nothing more than a Murdoch conspiracy has morphed into the shining light of polls,highly credible and truly reflects the wishes of the electorate and now they can't wait for it to come out. ",53,TimOfAltona
2099,"Or is it that Newspoll only has any credibility in the eyes of the cheer squad when it reports Labor in front otherwise as we regularly read in the Guardian threads, it isn't worth the paper it's written on and is nothing more than a tool to favour the conservative side of politics when it shows support for Labor falling? ",61,TimOfAltona
2100,Surprised me too. Either Labor are more on the nose than we thought or voters differentiated the 'sins' of Bronwyn from the good work the government has achieved across a number of policies. That said the Abbott government still have plenty of work ahead of them in the next 12 months.,51,TimOfAltona
2101,"He carries way too much baggage from knifing two sitting PMs', has had very public serious sexual criminal allegations directed at him and is seen to be beholding to the union movement who only represent a fraction of the work force. ",42,TimOfAltona
2102,So given Bill Shorten is ranked lower than Tony Abbott as preferred PM - any chance you can share with us what voters would prefer to Bill Shorten - TWO piles of steaming dog turds perhaps?,36,TimOfAltona
2103,Makes no difference who owns whom in betting - if I were in the Labor cheer squad I'd be throwing a lazy few thousand on Labor to win the next election and Scott Morrison or Julie Bishop as the Liberal leader at the next election - I keep reading comments in Guardian threads how both of those outcomes are certainty.,60,TimOfAltona
2104,It is no secret that Bronwyn Bishop was the great nemesis of the Labor front bench and they and their supporters cannot believe their luck that something like this came along. That said it is appropriate that she steps down and pays the penalty for her excesses with public money. ,51,TimOfAltona
2105,"How much this has damaged the PM is debatable, but undoubtedly he has lost some of his shine as a result. If Abbott spearheads a review and tightening up of the 'grey' areas when it comes to MP entitlements then he will gain some credit for that and Labor will be backing him as well. All good.",57,TimOfAltona
2106,"Abbott is correct, he should have moved on this matter a good 7 days before he did and yes he will lose some of his shine as a result. ",30,TimOfAltona
2107,"That said, the right appointment for Speaker will take a lot of heat out of the debate and settle things down in parliament almost immediately - providing Labor don't conduct themselves in the same disorderly manner they have since going into Opposition, things should be fine.  ",48,TimOfAltona
2108,"Wow, the Labor/Greens cheer squad are only too happy to try and milk this as much as they can while it takes the focus and heat off their own failing Leader. Sooner or later this will drop off the pages and we are back to talking about Bloob Shortstop again.",50,TimOfAltona
2109,"I don't have an opinion on Bruce Scott, but looks like he will be acting Speaker next week so we will see how he goes - the other thing is he has announced his retirement recently. You are right though, unlikely to go to a National Party MP when the Liberals have such strong numbers in the House.",58,TimOfAltona
2110,"Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the new Speaker will come from a range of 90 government MP's and Philip Ruddock is the most experienced of all of them and will add considerable gravitas to the role. ",41,TimOfAltona
2111,"As much as you want a Labor/Greens MP to be Speaker you have to wait until they are in government again, that is some considerable time off yet - perhaps in another two terms depending on what happens with the Liberal leadership.",42,TimOfAltona
2112,"Always good to see Turnbull has the Labor cheer squad breaking out into a cold sweat - for they know only too well their man is no match for a Turnbull lead government. In fact a Turnbull lead government has the capacity to keep Labor warming the opposition benches for years to come, if for no other reason there are plenty of Labor supporters who would switch sides if Turnbull was to be PM. ",75,TimOfAltona
2113,"Well he did get her to stand down, granted it was probably 7 days too late, but Gillard set the precedent on that with her bunkering down for weeks trying to protect Craig Thomson.",34,TimOfAltona
2114,I hope the Guardian report on Malcolm Turnbull's interviews this morning - he made some very good comments on this issue and about MPs entitlements in general which even the Labor/Greens cheer squad could not disagree. ,37,TimOfAltona
2115,Good response to this by Malcolm. He was spot on about MPs and their expenses that no one could disagree with except totally biased Labor cheer squadders concerned that Turnbull could replace Abbott.,33,TimOfAltona
2116,"Perhaps if Labor MPs stopped behaving like primary school children and continued flouting the standing orders after being warned several times they would not have been thrown out. More should have been thrown out, the Speaker showed great restraint IMHO.",40,TimOfAltona
2117,"I think it's a fair observation that it matters not who the PM and Leader of Government Business march up to the Speakers Chair next, the Labor/Greens cheer squad will be blindly attacking that individual with a vengeance - it's started already before a person has even been appointed. ",50,TimOfAltona
2118,"As for Labor, they will be quick to 'test' whoever gets the gig to A) see how much nonsense they can get away with in QT and B) see who will receive the honour of being the first Labor MP thrown out by the new Speaker. We should open up a book on who will be first to get thrown out - I have a fair idea. ",68,TimOfAltona
2119,Very interesting that it is Malcolm Turnbull hitting all the airwaves this morning and speaking a fair amount of common sense over this issue - makes you wonder if it is a planned tactic by the government or it really is just Malcolm announcing the creation of 4000 new jobs associated with the NBN. Either way he's looking solid at the moment compared to others IMHO,66,TimOfAltona
2120,"The ALP eat one of their own at the drop of a hat, except where in Gillard's case with Thomson, he was shown loyalty to prop up her failing government. ",31,TimOfAltona
2121,Nonsense - he displayed very good leadership . You have to go back to Gillard to see weak leadership - the way she protected Craig Thomson despite all the evidence. THAT was weak leadership - destroyed he in the end.,40,TimOfAltona
2122,"I like Bronwyn, this expense issue aside, she did a great job in keeping a lid on the disruptive tactics Labor decided to adopt in parliament after they were decimated last election. ",33,TimOfAltona
2123,Good move by Abbott to shut this down..... No one could criticise him for not showing leadership and tapping Bronwyn on the shoulder to give the government clear air next week. ,32,TimOfAltona
2124,"Hate to be the bearer of bad news comrade, but with the government having significantly superior numbers in the lower house after the drubbing of Labor in 2013 I seriously doubt anyone from Labor will be asked to sit in the Big Chair......in fact the chances of that happening are about the same as Bill Shorten one day being an Australian PM.",62,TimOfAltona
2125,Looks like Bronwyn will have the last laugh - it is now only a matter of time before Labor Party luminaries are uncovered over travel 'rorts' as a result of the investigation announced by the PM today. ,38,TimOfAltona
2126,"The comments of the past few days over this issue are reminiscent of the lead up to the great 1789 revolution in France which prompts me to observe the comments made about the great unwashed masses back then - ""The peasants are revolting!""",43,TimOfAltona
2127,The ALP will treading very carefully here -the last thing they want is forensic examination of some or any of their MP's travel claims going back over the years...Tony Burke and his family holiday extravaganza is a case in point...there will be more on this in coming days.,48,TimOfAltona
2128,"My view is the Speaker needs to stand aside, either while these allegations are investigated or fully retire from the role, notwithstanding that in either event a full, proper and transparent investigation is still warranted. ",36,TimOfAltona
2129,"Because Gillard's were fake , they were a tactic by her puppet master McTernan to try and soften her looks, but the media rightly called her out on it. ",30,TimOfAltona
2130,"Unlike the Labor Party who eat then excrete their own in a blink of an eye, Abbott strenuously backs his team until there is compelling evidence that he has no choice but to cut them loose - pretty much what you would expect from a good leader. ",48,TimOfAltona
2131,"You somehow omitted the reason Slipper was put into the Speaker role in the first place - had something to do with the Gillard PM woman knifing an excellent Speaker in Harry Jenkins, whose father was a Speaker before him. ",41,TimOfAltona
2132,Why did Gillard knife Harry? - to try and do a grubby deal to prop up her failing administration knowing full well peter Slipper had more baggage on him than the left luggage room at Heathrow Airport. ,38,TimOfAltona
2133,"A stunt because they and everyone else knows they have such piddly numbers in the lower house it is doomed before it even gets up - in fact it wont even debated - ""I move the member be longer heard"" will shut it all down before it wastes time in the parliament. ",53,TimOfAltona
2134,We look forward with great enthusiasm to the Guardian article (I'm sure it's on it's way) about Tony Burkes alleged multiple instances of claiming personal travel/holidays to the Australian taxpayer - it's pretty much splashed across every other media outlet and even stranger is that no one in this thread even wants to discuss it. ,56,TimOfAltona
2135,"Fair to say Bronwyn could crawl across a kilometre of broken glass on her bare hands and knees begging for forgiveness and the cheer squad for Labor and the Greens would still be screeching ""off with her head"". ",39,TimOfAltona
2136,This has nothing to do with any moral effrontery they are supposedly claiming but everything to do with payback - revenge is sweet and no one does revenge better than a bitter and twisted Labor party and it's supporters.,39,TimOfAltona
2137,"Just as it is the media who have taken up the cause against the Minnesota dentist who killed Cecil the lion, the Bronwyn Bishop saga will only prevail whilst sections of the media elect to continue milking the story to see what comes out the other end. ",48,TimOfAltona
2138,"So with all the Labor/Greens cheer squad calling for Bronwyn's head as sweet payback, their thoughts must now turn to who would replace her to lead the government into it's second term? ",33,TimOfAltona
2139,"Bronwyn Bishop, that long time nemesis of the ALP, seems to be copping a bit of flack from the cheer squad who smell blood so come swarming into the thread to spew forth their confected anger hoping a new Liberal Speaker will be in the chair when parliament resumes. ",50,TimOfAltona
2140,"It would be a shame to see her move out of the role, she's had a tough gig with a childish and recalcitrant Labor party trying to make up for their small numbers in the house by creating constant white noise during QT, but it will be interesting to see who may replace her if she chooses to step aside. ",61,TimOfAltona
2141,"All the huff and puff about how badly Gillard was treated and yet we have seen the most vile, sexist and disparaging remarks thrown at Bronwyn Bishop from you and your cohorts in recent weeks. ",36,TimOfAltona
2142,"Just quietly Janey, if you go back and have a look it was the High Court that scuttled Gillard's desperate effort to halt the damage already inflicted by her own party. ",32,TimOfAltona
2143,Going out and providing a meet and greet taxi service back to Australia for people arriving by people smuggler boats is certain to lead to hundreds of boats departing for Australia and lead to mass tragedy as we've seen both when Labor opened the gates previously and more recently in the Mediterranean.  ,54,TimOfAltona
2144,How about getting the Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords filmed snorting cocaine from a female prostitute's breast and then sitting in a chair wearing a red bra on the show? ,33,TimOfAltona
2145,Now there's some real Labor talent for you. Perhaps the ALP will have an opening for him - we hear they are on the look out for a new leader.,30,TimOfAltona
2146,If I was the PM I would now be seriously considering lifting the 'ban' by doing a solo appearance on the program. He has acquired enough political capital to front up to the program and tackle the predictable questions from the Labor/Greens cheer squad sitting in the audience. ,49,TimOfAltona
2147,You seem to be just as confused as many others in this thread - Boswell is not in government and is not even in politics since he retired last year.,30,TimOfAltona
2148,If the Border Force or Australian Navy have a policy of towing all boats back to Australia or transferring people onto naval vessels then you have provided the people smugglers with a perfect business model with thousands of boats heading to Australia along with the guaranteed mass drownings.,48,TimOfAltona
2149,"Irrespective of any temporary bans on LNP front bench attendees, there were a plethora of suitable contemporary Liberal Party representatives to negate the predictable ho hum propaganda emanating from the mouth of the Qld Premier.",35,TimOfAltona
2150,"Boswell was referencing asylum seeker intake quotas, of which Australia I think has the second highest in the world, as opposed to countries who have lost control of their borders and thousands flow in each week.",36,TimOfAltona
2151,"Between you and me, in these threads I see the current PM labelled with significantly harsher &amp; grubbier names on a daily basis and for the life of me cannot find any comments from you accusing or denouncing the authors as being sexist or demeaning. ",46,TimOfAltona
2152,I was so looking forward to the panel depicting Plibbers scurrying out of the venue to elude the boat turn back vote and hiding out amongst the mops in the janitors closet - only to find Penny Wong already in there. ,42,TimOfAltona
2153,"At least the Palestinians have the ability to fight back, the poor West Papuans' get pummelled by the Indonesian soldiers and police tantamount to genocide &amp; on our very doorstep. ",31,TimOfAltona

2155,I would like to see a poll targeting the criminal people smuggling operators up in Indonesia - which government would you like to see in office after the next election? ,31,TimOfAltona
2156,I think we all know who would get 100% of the vote - here's a tip - it is not the party that has successfully shut down the People smuggling trade in this part of the world. ,38,TimOfAltona
2157,"Funny thing Dais, the PM has around 8-10 engagements each day.....at some point he has to call a halt to doorstops or his schedule is thrown out. Just the way it is. ",33,TimOfAltona
2158,It's high time the media stopped showing its bias against the government - Labor is a protected species when it comes to the media. When will the media start doing their job instead of running a protection racket for Labor?,40,TimOfAltona
2159,Labor need to go away and work out how they can unite a deeply divided party and then come back to us when they think they have a viable and united party.  ,34,TimOfAltona
2160,"Funny how when things go rapidly pear shaped for the ALP, the Labor cheer squad suddenly only want to talk about, of all things, helicopters. There is an adjective to describe that human behaviour, but it escapes me for the moment.",41,TimOfAltona
2161,"Pretty much there has been a conga line of ministers on Sky this morning, all being interviewed about Labor's dysfunction. You need to broaden your media interests beyond Guardian and Socialist weekly.",32,TimOfAltona
2162,"Please provide the link where Abbott is quoted as saying he would resign on Aug 08 if the coalition is not ahead in the polls. If not, you are simply adding to the growing perception from both sides that you are a goose in these threads.",46,TimOfAltona
2163,So the leader of the ALP and the Deputy leader are publicly divided - one wants to copy the government's successful Operations Sovereign Borders formula and the other is pushing for Australia to be a magnet for people smuggler boats? ,41,TimOfAltona
2164,I'm with you - very important to keep the people smugglers informed of tactics used to shut down their deadly trade....the more information we feed them the easier it is for them to succeed.,34,TimOfAltona
2165,"Following the failed Gillard experiment, if Labor try for a person who will once again use the misogyny tactic to try and win support for her and her party, then they deserve to stay in opposition for a generation or more IMHO.",42,TimOfAltona
2166,Yes will be interesting to see how the dust settles after Labor's display of massive disunity over the past 24 hrs and it's not over yet by a long shot. ,31,TimOfAltona
2167,The Labor Left should have got up - then there would have been a distinct difference in policy between the government and the ALP going into the next election - then we could allow voters decide who they want to govern. ,42,TimOfAltona
2168,This comment is typical of Labor and highlights why they are in opposition - all these 'ideas' costing multi-billions of dollars with no way to pay for them. Labor are abject failures when it comes to implementing major infrastructure projects - look at he shambles surrounding their last go at rolling out an NBN.,54,TimOfAltona
2169,"Increasing the government intake will not solve the issue of millions of displaced people and makes zero difference to people smugglers - if Labor give them a sign that Operation Sovereign Borders will be relaxed, the boats will start up again along with the associated drownings.",46,TimOfAltona
2170,You need both deterrents to make the policy work - bringing people who have previously arrived here by boat into Australia is precisely what the people smugglers want the government to do......they have their business model back.,37,TimOfAltona
2171,He knew well in advance of his little announcement re boat turn backs. Shorten is a numbers man - he knew he had the numbers or else he wouldn't have gone ahead with it - too much to lose if he got voted down.,44,TimOfAltona
2172,This is going to be highly entertaining 3 days and thanks to the Guardian for providing a rolling commentary on the Labor Party tearing themselves apart before our very eyes. ,31,TimOfAltona
2173,"After the crash and burn of the Gillard experiment, do you really think the ALP will knife another leader and insert a left over from the failed Gillard administration? ",30,TimOfAltona
2174,Something tells me this conference will be a gift to the government.....already the message to voters is Labor are divided and dysfunctional....nothing much has changed since the dark days graphically portrayed in The Killing Season recently. ,37,TimOfAltona
2175,"One thing is certain - if the Left prevail and the party endorse a relaxing of Operation Sovereign Borders, Labor can look forward to years in the political wilderness. ",30,TimOfAltona
2176,Shorten was on the money...but his two biggest rivals for leadership Albo and the hapless Plibersek look like consigning Labor to the opposition benches for another two or three terms.,30,TimOfAltona
2177,"Good to see an increase in GST on the table - just like same-sex marriage, a GST increase will occur in Australia at some stage and it may as well be discussed and mapped out for all to see before the next election.  ",45,TimOfAltona
2178,The successful NZ model was to go from 10% to 12.5% and then John Key took 15% to an election and smashed NZ Labour out of the ball park. Interesting the NZ GST is a broad based tax including fresh food etc. ,43,TimOfAltona
2179,"Jem whichever way you cut this, the world cannot cope with mass migration of millions of people from continent to continent without creating significant and serious social and economic upheaval, not to mention the thousands of people who lose their lives along the way.",44,TimOfAltona

2181,"I was in Paris recently and the shanty-like ghettos springing up in and around the fringes of the city, mainly around bridges and railway lines near the Peripherique were disturbing. ",31,TimOfAltona
2182,"Can you imagine the mess we would be in with asylum seekers if we gave the Greens the keys to our border security - hundreds of thousands of people heading to Australia on boats.

2185,I'm with you and while they are at it take a look at the millions Labor paid to the smugglers onshore when they were in government. That would be very interesting.,31,TimOfAltona
2186,Push comes to shove and voters will not endorse a rabble of a party who stand for nothing and just hang off the policy coat tails of the LNP government. ,31,TimOfAltona
2187,"It's all but dead and buried yet you still want to harp on about it. The focus has moved away from Bishop onto Shorten - you know, the guy who wants us to believe he will be our next Prime Minister. LOL.",42,TimOfAltona
2188,Pulling a target out of the air with nothing to back it up other than 'aspirations' ain't going to cut it.........best Bill go back to the drawing board and come back and tell us how much our energy costs would increase by and how many thousands of jobs will be lost to achieve that target and where the funding will come from to support it. Then we can decide if it's a good policy or not. ,77,TimOfAltona

2192,"The other significant news around this story , apart from the Labor leadership giving Tony Abbott and the government the big thumbs up on Operation Sovereign Borders, is that Marles chose to announce this massive ALP backflip via one of Rupert Murdoch's publications. ",44,TimOfAltona
2193,Very interesting that Leigh Sales brought up the topic of Shorten knifing two serving PMs - she used those very words - right here is why Labor made a huge mistake in parachuting Shorten into the leadership - he carries way too much baggage which the government and media can call on in the lead up to the next election.,60,TimOfAltona
2194,The point of stopping the boats is clearly lost on you. Stopping the boats means there will eventually be no more asylum seekers in detention... The detention centres will be emptied and shut.  ,35,TimOfAltona
2195,"Excellent interview which exposed the flaws in Labor's leadership we all knew. Tough for Labor supporters to see their 'leader' crash and burn I know, but on the flip side it may expedite a much needed change of leader.",39,TimOfAltona
2196,Weak argument Daisy. Bronwyn Bishop is old news. The latest news is Labor endorsing Operation Sovereign Borders and giving Tony Abbott and his government a big tick of approval.  ,31,TimOfAltona

2203,A little birdie told me this conference is Bill's last big hurrah. Either he stamps his credentials as a leader who take the ALP to an election and win or they will look to invoke the get out of jail clause for a leadership change. ,46,TimOfAltona
2204,We know Albo has the numbers from the rank and file members and that Shorten was soundly rejected by them but the factions in the party room installed Bill against the members' wishes and look what's happened. Lame duck leader.  ,42,TimOfAltona

2206,"Labor totally lost control of Australia's borders and look at the mess that created, the billions of dollars tax payers money, not to mention 1000+ people drowning at sea and all still being fixed up by the current government. ",40,TimOfAltona
2207,"Whilst Labor tussle with the notion of whether they will restart the people smuggling operation between Indonesia and Australia, I say this to Labor - do that and expect to see yourself in the political wilderness for years to come.",40,TimOfAltona
2208,"Where this kind of thing always falls over for Labor is they have no idea how to implement, what the cost will be, where the money will come from to fund this, how many thousands of union jobs will be lost along the way and naturally they also need to be in government before any of this happens - a big fat zero on that one too.",67,TimOfAltona
2209,Newsflash................Ashley Madison website hacked - stop - sordid long term bed hopping affair between Labor and Greens laid bare - stop - Mark Butler in crisis talks at the conference - stop - jilted Australian voters initiate divorce proceedings against cheaters - stop - Labor conference delegates vow to make a clean break from their Greens bed partners and remain faithful to Labor values - stop - more to come - stop.,72,TimOfAltona
2210,At the crux of Greece's woes is that tax avoidance has been a national sport in that country for decades......billions of untaxed Greek euros squirrelled away in Swiss Bank accounts. ,31,TimOfAltona
2211,I don't disagree with your sentiments. Where it all goes horribly wrong is accepting people who come by boat leads to mass maritime migration which rapidly gets out of control as we experienced when Rudd dismantled the successful Howard government policy. ,42,TimOfAltona
2212,Labor well and truly lost control of our maritime borders which lead to tens of thousands of men women and children flooding into immigration internment camps and 1000+ poor souls drowning. ,32,TimOfAltona
2213,"That said, there is no evidence thus far that this particular boat is a paid 'people smuggler' boat. It may just be a group of people hoping to enter Australia through the back door with the help of Australian refugee advocate groups.",42,TimOfAltona

2216,"Could not help notice that one of the panelists was the President of the Australian Labor Party who chose his words very carefully when it came to the subject of travel entitlements, very, very carefully.  ",37,TimOfAltona
2217,This topic still on the front page? Must be another slow news day. Hopefully this will be gone in a day or two and we can wait until the outcome of the Treasury inquiry in a few weeks. ,39,TimOfAltona
2218,Or do the rules surrounding MP travel entitlements contain so many grey areas that MPs can legitimately get away with attending party fund raising events at the tax payers expense? ,31,TimOfAltona
2219,Both sides of parliament need to examine this whole travel entitlement area and agree upon reforming the rules so there are no grey areas remaining ie: are party fundraisers deemed official MP business or should political parties cover their own costs associated with these? ,45,TimOfAltona
2220,"You may be right as well, but blow me down it looks like these parliamentary delegation jaunts to Europe cost around $90k....yet everyone is singling out the current Speaker as hers being excessive. ",34,TimOfAltona
2221,Alan Jones made a pertinent comment tonight re Bronwyn Bishops $88k European Parliament trip - the last delegation going to the same event was Labor's Bob Hogg who spent $95k on the trip. ,34,TimOfAltona
2222,Always amazes me how much the Labor/Greens cheer squad want to see people boarding leaky people smuggler boats and heading to Australia as they did when the last labor/Greens government were in office - how many drowned again? 1000+? ,40,TimOfAltona
2223,Labor have proved to be an ineffective opposition and increasingly it seems the Greens are quietly filling the void left by Labor. This was to be expected though as Labor journey from scratch through their rebuilding phase - a fair way to go yet IMHO.,45,TimOfAltona
2224,I'm just hanging out until the next Labor or Greens MP gets caught out with entitlement 'irregularities' - just watch all the 'commentator's' so keen to express their disgust in this thread fall silent or disappear altogether. ,38,TimOfAltona
2225,If the Treasury investigation determines this may be more than just an 'error of judgment' then the Speaker has no choice but to stand down from the role and return to the government benches pending a full and transparent outcome. ,41,TimOfAltona
2226,It must be on Abbott's mind who would replace the current Speaker if that is required. With such a massive majority in the lower house the government has no shortages of a replacement. ,34,TimOfAltona
2227,"Abbott did indeed say that, but he has always said GST is a matter for the states, they have to approve it or otherwise and last I looked the commonwealth are not attempting to increase the GST. Mike Baird, NSW premier, is putting it out on the table for discussion at the next premiers' shindig in Sydney.",57,TimOfAltona
2228,It's only a matter of time before our GST increases. The state premiers will agree to it providing it has the same exemptions - the increase in revenue for the states is too compelling an argument to not go down that path. ,43,TimOfAltona

2230,"We know stopping the boats has saved perhaps thousands of lives which has certainly had a high impact on those people and we know the business model of the deadly people smuggling trade has experienced a high impact by being shut down, but what is the high impact on Australian society mean?  ",54,TimOfAltona
2231,"I'd just once love to hear a Labor/Greens supporter admit that the current Sovereign Borders policy has saved lives, not just a handful, but could be in the thousands of people who would not be alive today if it were not for the government's policy.  ",47,TimOfAltona

2234,I know the term well - it's what occurred to throw an inept and dysfunctional Labor/Greens government out of office and it is what will keep them out of office for years and years to come.,36,TimOfAltona
2235,No point Labor trying to dress up their conference/fundraiser as some kind of Marxist quest for a socialist utopia in this country without submitting firm policies on key issues. ,30,TimOfAltona
2236,"This is important because so far all we have seen from their leader is that Labor will emulate the current government's successful policies when it comes to national security, border protection (stopping the boats), tax breaks for small business, meta data collection, citizenship stripping and wiping out entrenched corruption within the trade union movement. ",55,TimOfAltona
2237,"Labor need to stand up, show some courage and start putting some policies out there which demonstrate they can at least string a policy together that is not designed to either placate the Greens or copy the government. ",39,TimOfAltona
2238,You mean the absolute shit fight between Labor's Left &amp; Right which will tear the party apart and most likely lead to Labor remaining in the political wilderness for years and years to come? ,35,TimOfAltona

2241,No amount of regurgitating that John McTernan scripted rant from the failed Gillard changes the fact that the Slipper issue and the current issue are at any examination poles apart.,30,TimOfAltona
2242,"Speaking of boats Ray, this topic will be a doozy at the conference and has the potential to singularly knock Labor out of contention to form government for years. ",30,TimOfAltona
2243,"No-one wants to see the boats start up again, the detention centres filling up with men, women and children and most importantly, large scale drownings occurring as they did under the last Labor/Greens administration.",34,TimOfAltona
2244,All this inflated talk about the Speaker standing aside or resigning (let us all wait for the outcome from the Treasury inquiry first) gives pause to thought about who the next Speaker would be if ghat was the final outcome? ,41,TimOfAltona
2245,"It will be interesting to see of Labor stop acting like recalcitrant primary school children in parliament with a different Speaker in the chair? They are certain to 'test' a new Speaker to see what they get away with, nothing more is certain.",43,TimOfAltona
2246,Yep. Exactly why the LNP will be returned. Labor have not even started to fix up the rot that set in during the R/G/R years and next week's conference will only confirm in voters minds why Labor are not yet fit to govern. ,44,TimOfAltona
2247,Probably some confusion over what you are trying to build here - when the Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives travels overseas the ground transport is organised by the local Australian High Commission/Embassy. The Speaker would not be aware of ground transport arrangements or the costs associated with it - the Dept of Foreign Affairs takes care of all that. ,62,TimOfAltona
2248,"The Labor/Greens cheer squad are behaving like sharks in a feeding frenzy - releasing pent up frustration and hoping they can keep this story alive as long as possible following a horrendous few weeks for the ALP. I suspect however it will end up as a classic ""Nothing to see here folks"" moment as Treasury find no case to answer.",60,TimOfAltona
2249,As much as Labor and their cheer squad want this story to hang around for a while longer yet it only has a couple of days to run before the ALP's problems dominate the front page again.  ,39,TimOfAltona
2250,The problem with your comment is that you call for this matter to be investigated to determine the facts but you also determine in advance of that investigation that she is guilty of a number of indiscretions surrounding this matter. ,41,TimOfAltona
2251,If the Speaker has done the wrong thing and the evidence is proved beyond doubt that hers was a deliberate act to deceive over tax payers money then she has no choice but to step dow and she should. ,40,TimOfAltona
2252,Under the circumstances a good interview by the Speaker. She answered the rapid fire questions from some hostile media pretty well. She was dead right about Tony Burke too. ,30,TimOfAltona
2253,"Well, at least the Royal Commission into Trade Unions which would only have been initiated by the current government is in the process of unmasking many a cover up - some involving the current LOTO to boot.",37,TimOfAltona
2254,Trying to create a diversion you hope will last until your upcoming conference is over is fanciful. We will be watching the disaster unfold at the conference with great interest.,30,TimOfAltona
2255,"Ian, wouldn't it be better to determine if she has actually done anything wrong yet - you along with the rest of the Labor cheer squad have already made up your mind that she has committed an offence - without knowing the full facts of the matter. ",48,TimOfAltona
2256,Peter Slipper only found himself in that role as a consequence of one of Gillard's tricky attempts to prop up her rapidly failing government ( to be fair I think it was Albo playing puppet master to Gillard on this occasion) and Slippers taxi voucher debacle was a result of Slipper visiting ACT wineries for a personal leisure excursion. ,60,TimOfAltona
2257,Contrast that with Bronwyn Bishop who was selected out of a very wide range of suitable and available LNP candidates as the best person for the role and this issue has surfaced as a result of Bronwyn attending an official party event in her capacity as both Leader of the House and a Liberal MP - none of that can be said of Peter Slipper's situation. ,67,TimOfAltona
2258,Bourke is being particularly mischievous over this and he knows it - for him this is all about payback and trying to keep the story alive to detract from the very public dramas swirling in and around the ALP currently. ,41,TimOfAltona
2259,"A fine photo at the head of the article of the 4 most senior Liberal Party figures. All four look very happy, knowing as they do that another LNP term in office is just around the corner.",37,TimOfAltona
2260,"hahaha...poor deluded person. Labor's problems are only just beginning and Shorten has not been called back for his second appearance at the RC yet, plus the train wreck of a national conference starts next week where Bill will either sink or swim as the left try and impose their will on the right, including re-starting the people smuggler trade between Indonesia and Australia.  ",65,TimOfAltona
2261,"Not sure, apart from the usual Labor/Greens v LNP vitriol why there is so much animosity directed at The Speaker. Under the circumstances, she actually does a pretty good job in the role.  ",35,TimOfAltona
2262,If people are going by what they see on the ABC feed from QT then I suggest you best go and sit in the chamber during QT and you will soon see the wall of yelling emanating from the Labor side right from the first question. Some Labor MP's are worse than others and it seems they have a little contest going as to who can be thrown out the most times. ,73,TimOfAltona
2263,"Here's an idea, how about the Labor MP's give up their seat to the Green candidate they went up against in the last election and then we would have an actual opposition party in the Lower House. ",38,TimOfAltona
2264,The labor politicians richly deserve to be thrown out - they continue to yell out like school kids after warnings are given - Bishop has no other choice but to throw them out. Go and sit in the chamber during QT and you'll very soon see what I mean.,49,TimOfAltona
2265,2. A vote for the Greens is pretty much a vote for the ALP candidate in that seat ( two or three seats exempted) so worth bearing that in mind.,30,TimOfAltona
2266,"Last I looked, Peter Slipper was visiting wineries in and around Canberra on a personal jaunt, whilst Bishop was attending an official Liberal party fund raiser in her capacity of a Liberal MP. ",34,TimOfAltona
2267,"Yes, the helicopter was probably excessive and you would have to wonder who planted that seed in her mind to charter a helicopter because she was behind schedule. That aside, it seems she has both repaid the money and paid a 25% penalty.  ",45,TimOfAltona
2268,"There are bigger things needing attention for the Labor/Greens cheer squad, but I guess this provides them a nice distraction for a few days from Bill Shorten's and the ALP's woeful week.",32,TimOfAltona
2269,I'm with you. It's disgraceful that our PM dare to attend a memorial for the victims of those killed in MH370. It should only be allowed to happen if it is a  ,34,TimOfAltona
2270,This will all blow over in a day or two and we can start focussing on the more important things occurring within the political spectrum. Plenty of them..... Labor party national conference for starters.,34,TimOfAltona
2271,"Agreed , it's not a great look but bear in mind if she knew it was against the rules of entitlement at the time, there is no way she would have done it.....all MPs expenses are totally transparent and find their way into the public domain - which is why this little storm in a tea cup has hit today.",60,TimOfAltona
2272,Plenty of confected (pretend) anger in these threads and has more to do with Bishop throwing out recalcitrant Labor MPs in the Lower House than a quick helicopter ride.  ,31,TimOfAltona
2273,"Fair to say Labor have been carrying on like primary school children in QT....constant yelling out, childish antics and baiting the Speaker - almost turned it into a sport/honour badge to see who can be thrown out the most times.  ",42,TimOfAltona
2274,"One thing we do know about the Labor left...if they give any hint that they are about to start up the people smuggling boats between Indonesia and Australia again, they can look forward to years in the political wilderness.",39,TimOfAltona
2275,"There is plenty of media pushing the barrow for the Left. Take this esteemed publication for starters, not to mention Fairfax regularly calling it as they see it plus the hoards of social media that have taken up the fight against the current government.  ",46,TimOfAltona
2276,"Make no mistake ALP, sound bites and 20 second media grabs from the upcoming conference is what roughly 80% of Australian voters will absorb and take away with them regarding the health of Labor and their ability to govern. ",40,TimOfAltona
2277,"Just raise the GST to 12.5% and be done with it, or even go the whole hog to 15% - we'll still be lower than most developed countries and it will go a long way to fixing our budgetary problems. ",41,TimOfAltona
2278,"Tax evasion is more than just a national pastime in Greece, it's a badge of honour to see how many untaxed Greek euros can be squirrelled away in Swiss Bank accounts. ",32,TimOfAltona
2279,"What a bunch of ageist, sexist and misogynistic grubby comments from the Labor/Greens cheer squad. Daisy even you who complained long and hard about Julia Gillard's treatment are joining in with your own abusive and sexist comments directed at the Speaker.  ",43,TimOfAltona
2280,The responses in this thread are telling - here is an article espousing the difficulties Bill Shorten is making for himself and his party and all the Labor cheer squad want to talk about is Tony Abbott. ,38,TimOfAltona
2281,"Wrong - it exposed a few issues around impropriety which are still under investigation and Shorten is more then likely going to be recalled to the witness box. The commissions findings are not due until later this year. Trying to pretend it is all over and Shorten has been cleared is...well you know.......at best optimistic, at worst delusional.",58,TimOfAltona
2282,Your problem is that your man is not up to the task at hand and no amount of excuses to try and cover his arse for him can stop the rot within Labor. ,34,TimOfAltona
2283,IMHO Labor are facing the greatest crisis in its history - all due to the fallout from the R/G/R train wreck and unfortunately for you and the party a key player/architect of that disaster is now your supposed 'Leader'. ,40,TimOfAltona
2284,"I'm all for free speech and all that, but seriously mate, your anti-media posts are akin to that mosquito buzzing in your ear when you are trying to get to sleep.  ",33,TimOfAltona
2285,"Right here is why Labor are constantly on the back foot - blame the media, blame Tony Abbott, blame the weather, blame anyone or anything except your own party for the disunity, dysfunction and failure. ",36,TimOfAltona
2286,"If you are an ALP member, stop bitching and moaning on Guardian threads and get along to the national conference and have your say. Remember it was the members who rejected Shorten in the first place. If Labor are to recover from here it needs to be thrashed out at the conference.",52,TimOfAltona
2287,It will take a lot more than just Bill standing up on stage and leading off on a few verses of Solidarity Forever to convince Australian voters Labor are in good shape. ,33,TimOfAltona
2288,In the meantime the Libs will get on and eventually replace Abbott with a less polarising leader who will move the party back towards the centre which will further diminish Labor's electoral prospects IMHO.,34,TimOfAltona

2292,Well do you want the cattle exports to remain at present quotas or do you not. Half the Labor/Greens cheer squad are on here saying it's a good thing live cattle exports are being curtailed and the other half are saying the quotas should be maintained and it's all the government's fault they have been reduced? ,57,TimOfAltona
2293,Probably the last time they actually came out with one. Now that would be a few months ago. Pretty much all they have done lately is echo the government's policies.,30,TimOfAltona
2294,"Forget Abbott - he alone will not deliver the ALP government. You need a leader who can take it up to the government. Albo is the closest you have to that, but even he is not PM material. ",39,TimOfAltona
2295,Very good comment by the way. Far too many Labor supporters are burying their head in the sand and pretending everything is sweet with their party &amp; think Abbott's personal polling will get them over the line.,37,TimOfAltona
2296,It all comes down to political leadership. The LNP may have an unpopular leader ( for now ) but Labor have an absolute dud leader and there is no remedy in sight for the party. ,36,TimOfAltona
2297,"Consider this, if Abbott was as bad as most on this thread want us to believe, the gap in the polls would be significant, 15 points or more, yet here we have the Coalition enjoying the highest primary vote, the book makers backing the government to win next election and the voters unable to differentiate between Abbott and Shorten in the popularity stakes.

2300,Making derogatory and ageist comments seems to be all the Labor cheer squad have left in their kit. Your grubby comment aimed at persons over 60 is deplorable. Time to pull your head in IMHO,35,TimOfAltona
2301,"Labor had better sort out their dysfunctional leadership woes quick smartMany on here believe that due to Abbott's perceived unpopularity, a half used toilet roll could lead Labor to an election victory. I believe Australian voters are a tad smarter than that and will not only want to take a good look at the half used toilet roll but also the policies that sit behind it. This is where it all goes horribly pear shaped for what some people laughingly refer to as the 'opposition'.",85,TimOfAltona
2302,That was when Gillard was still PM before Shorten knifed her. All bets are off on how many years Labor will be in opposition although the bookies have LNP clear winner at the next election so safe to assume another 4 years at least.,44,TimOfAltona
2303,Shorten is pretty much regarded as unelectable now and in the absence of an obvious replacement voters are largely looking to the LNP to show leadership for the country. ,30,TimOfAltona
2304,"One can only imagine the polls if Abbott decided to stand down or is replaced by Turnbull. Labor would need to start planning for the 2019 election, 2016 would be all over for them. ",35,TimOfAltona
2305,Last I looked John Hewson had not been convicted of threatening to kill ASIO officers and tweeting that 2 female journos should be raped....a bit of difference there don't you think?,31,TimOfAltona
2306,Because only the rabid lefties are still interested in this Q&amp;Asaga because it gives them some kind of platform to launch confected attacks against the government. The majority of the country are no longer interested as to whether Malcolm Turnbull goes on Q&amp;A or not. ,46,TimOfAltona
2307,"Again facts are important when trying to mount an argument. The Abbott government have been emptying and closing down detention centres constructed by the previous Labor government. Many of Labor's detention centres have been closed since the LNP came to government. Not too many, in fact zero, have been built. ",51,TimOfAltona
2308,"A reasonable viewpoint. The problem with posting it on this thread is that it is full of people who see Turnbull as the person standing between them and Labor returning to office, so you end up with comments like the two above mine. Your point is entirely valid however.",49,TimOfAltona
2309,"Herein lies the problem for Labor - there is no obvious replacement for a Shorten. Albo gets a regular mention and as good a political street fighter he may be, he is not exactly Australian PM material. ",38,TimOfAltona
2310,As opposed to the ALP where half or more of current sitting ALP members don't support Bill Shorten. Disunity has always been the achillies heel of the Labor party and will see them continue to sit on the left of Madam Speaker for years to come.,46,TimOfAltona
2311,"How quickly you forget that Abbott is leader by virtue of a single party room vote. It does not take Einstein to work out that if Abbott's unpopularity continues and back benchers start getting nervous again as the next election looms closer it will not take much to tip the numbers the other way......particularly as Turnbull is streets ahead of anyone else , Labor or Liberal, as preferred PM.",69,TimOfAltona
2312,"Arbib was pulled by Gillard on the day of the show going to air, hence they were unable to find a replacement Labor stooge at such short notice - hence the empty chair.",33,TimOfAltona
2313,Your assertion that the federal police would not be following up on persons suspected of planning terror attacks if Labor were in office perfectly demonstrates why we will not be seeing Labor back in office for many years to come. Can't be trusted with border protection or national security.,49,TimOfAltona
2314,You must have missed the part where the ABC admitted to an error of judgement and apologised and also admonished the executive producer by serving him a written warning over allowing this convicted criminal and tweeter of calls for raping of female journalists a soapbox on live national TV. ,50,TimOfAltona
2315,Holding up Mallah as your poster boy against the government is pretty much scraping the bottom of the barrel for the Labor cheer squad and confirms in people's minds why Labor are well out of contention to form government in this country for many years to come.,47,TimOfAltona
2316,"Labor, along with their ever dwindling cohort of supporters recognise that a Turnbull lead government would wipe the floor with whatever the Labor party could muster at the present time, so all that is left is smear, innuendo and disingenuous comments calling on Turnbull to sacrifice his political career over an ABC television show. ",55,TimOfAltona
2317,"True. However, if the consequences of him not playing ball with the CFMEUs alleged demands were physical harm or destruction of his business then I think I know where the court would rule on this one. ",37,TimOfAltona
2318,"I'm with you. Clearly it's all his fault. If he was not operating a business in the first place, the CFMEU would not have come knocking on his door. Definitely his fault and he should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.",44,TimOfAltona

2322,All the commission can do is raise awareness of a range of options a person may have to assist them seek help from an abusive family member and also perhaps recommend how health care workers and law enforcement officials can provide better early identification and intervention to help an abused individual and/or the perpetrator.,54,TimOfAltona
2323,A real conundrum for the ALP. They know Shorten has under performed and is carrying way too much baggage to ever lead the ALP to an election win yet their 'rules' ensure they can't ditch him.  ,38,TimOfAltona
2324,"On Insiders this morning the panelist from the left believed Shorten was safe in his role for no other reason that there is no obvious successor who can step in and lead the party to an election, contrasting that with the Libs who have a strong candidate in Turnbull to lead the LNP to an election.

2329,Actually stopping the boats was not easy - after Labor and the Greens left the door so far open that tens of thousands arrived and 1000+ drowned it took a determined government with the backing of Australian voters to close it. Good to see however that the ALP have recognised their grave error and are now backing the government on border control.,62,TimOfAltona

2344,"Yet for some strange reason when the PM grants them their wish, temporarily at least, they are frothing at the mouth for a government minister, Malcolm Turnbull in this case, to be on the panel. ",36,TimOfAltona
2345,Point 2 - Turnbull does not need advice from the Labor/Greens cheer squad who are only too pleased to see him fall on his sword over a Q&amp;A storm in a teacup so he no longer presents a threat to labor and the Greens as our next PM ,49,TimOfAltona
2346,"Point 3 - If this issue is so important, Where is our supposed 'alternative' government on this issue? Plenty of Q&amp;A hyperventilating from their Guardian threads cheer squad but deftly silence from the people that matter, Shorten &amp; co. ",40,TimOfAltona
2347,"Point 4 - Everyone banging on about Tony Abbott not appearing on Q&amp;A, like the 'magnificent'Julia Gillard did...well that appearance certainly did wonders for her popularity didn't it? BTW, when did we last see Bill Shorten take questions on Q&amp;A? Just wondering.",42,TimOfAltona

2354,Nice try Daisy. O'Conner was smashed by Leigh Sales.If anyone had any doubts about Shorten before the interview they are left in no doubt now - Shorten will never be a PM of Australia and the funny thing is - half the Labor a Party agree. ,47,TimOfAltona
2355,Ahh..the good old Labor tactic...try to destroy the credibility of anyone they deem opposes them. This time lets all attack the RC Commissioner...that's certain to save Bill from his looming knifing.,31,TimOfAltona
2356,If I were an impartial observer of that interview I would come away with a strong impression that Shorten was caught out badly today if nothing else because of O'Conners obvious obfuscation. ,33,TimOfAltona
2357,Right here is the problem with the Labor cheer squad - unable to comprehend or understand that Labor were thrown out of government for very valid reasons and also thrown out because of a democratic election - calling the election illegal or invalid reflects denial and desperation. ,48,TimOfAltona
2358,"Leigh Sales nailed O'Conner. He was obfuscating and dancing around the question....all the while trying to get the words ""Tony"" and ""Abbott"" out as many times as he could get way with hoping no one was looking at Bill Shorten's almost crash and burn appearance at the TURC. ",49,TimOfAltona
2359,Right here is where it all goes pear shaped for the Labor cheer squad. Their strong preference is to focus entirely on a belief that an unpopular PM will deliver them office and hope that no one notices that Labor have actually done little or nothing about reforming their own party since the collapse of Sept 2013. ,58,TimOfAltona
2360,"3. Relationship with the Greens. Their love-hate association with the Greens is crippling the party. Either they are in bed or they are out of bed with the Greens. Too many in Labor want it both ways and it shows. The big question is can Labor ever hope to return to government without relying on the Greens to get them over the line? Awkward question I know, but it bears thinking about. ",73,TimOfAltona
2361,4. Too many ex-Union hacks treating the senate like it's a right of passage or a reward for services to the union movement....ditto the lower house. The hapless Shorten is a shining example. Unions represent a fraction of the Australian workforce. Eureka stockade happened a bloody long time ago and is no longer relevant to a new generation of voters.  ,62,TimOfAltona
2362,"5. Admit the Gillard experiment was a mistake for the Labor Party. It backfired so spectacularly that if Gillard had not been replaced at the last moment, Labor would be lucky to have 30 seats in the lower house. It was a disastrous period in the history of the ALP and an admission they got it wrong will go a long way towards regaining some kind of credibility in the eyes of voters. ",74,TimOfAltona
2363,6. Stop shooting the messenger. Media bashing is a popular pastime in Labor land. The majority of media/journos report it as they see it. If Labor were good enough at what they are supposed to be doing it will be positively reflected in the media. The ALP have generated enough shooting themselves in the foot ammunition to last a lifetime. This can be remedied by correctly addressing point 1 above. ,71,TimOfAltona
2364,"7. Stop the boats. No other issue is likely to tear apart the ALP and keep them out of government than this.If the left get their way they can kiss goodbye to any hope of returning to government. Majority of voters are rock solid behind the government's success in this area and any hint that a Labor government will restart the maritime people smuggling operation, the associated drownings at sea and the detention centres being filled up again with men, women and children ensures Labor a very very long occupancy on the opposition benches. ",95,TimOfAltona
2365,For those crying foul that Q&amp;A is starting to move from the left back to the centre - rest assured that the composition of the live studio audience which is regularly 40% Conservative voters and 60% Labor/Greens voters ensures the left will be heard the loudest.,46,TimOfAltona

He is floundering on the subject of accepting undisclosed personal benefits in return for settling an EBA. This point needs to be further canvassed and determined. Let's hope Stoljer can get to the bottom of that, one way or the other. ",59,TimOfAltona
2379,"RC revelations aside, Shorten came to the leadership with all sorts of heavy baggage from previous years...rape allegations, knifing of two sitting Labor PMs' (played out recently on The Killing Season), the ALP membership did not want him in the first place, his personal links to John Roskam and the list goes on.

2393,"Larissa Waters confirmed why the Greens are unlikely to ever get any more than just the one seat in the Lower House.

2415,Presumably the ones who hide behind a 'Tony Abbott-type' name or avatar will swap it to something resembling the name or likeness of whoever replaces Tony and so it starts all over again. ,34,TimOfAltona
2416,Abbott is highly intelligent observes politically savvy Katharine Murphy and in addition I suggest Abbott is certainly the more politically savvy compared to Shorten and for that reason will endure way beyond Shorten's rapidly floundering tenure as ALP leader.,39,TimOfAltona
2417,"There is a valid reason why that is so...Labor, particularly with Shorten as leader, are simply not up to the job and can't be trusted. Australians can see that. ",30,TimOfAltona

2420,You keep saying that but the reality is Labor are just not up to the job. Sitting back and hoping that the LNP are voted out as opposed to the ALP/Greens being voted in is delusional.

2425,"You only have to look at pretty much any Guardian thread and they are littered with grubby, vile and offensive comments directed at Peta Credlin, Julie Bishop, Bronwyn Bishop and recently Sophie Mirabella. Sadly Abbott's wife and daughters have been targeted by the left as well. ",47,TimOfAltona
2426,"Sadly many regular 'contributors' are serial offenders and often 'justify' their sexist &amp; offensive remarks by saying that Gillard copped heaps, so this is their form of 'payback'. Again, sadly many have taken it too far. ",37,TimOfAltona

2442,Clear to see Turnbull has the cheer squad very concerned. They know full well that a Turnbull lead government will keep Labor out of office for a generation or longer. ,31,TimOfAltona
2443,it is amusing indeed when you see all the comments on here from half the Labor cheer squad trying to build a fence around Shorten to protect him and the other half trying to tear it down and get rid of him. It seems most of Australia want the latter.,50,TimOfAltona

2446,"So the consensus of the Labor cheer squad, in this thread at least, is that it matters not whom leads Labor to the next election, it could be a burnt stick, Ivan Milat or tub of mango yogurt 12 days past it's use by date and Labor will still win. ",51,TimOfAltona
2447,"In other words, no-one has any confidence in Shorten be an effective leader of the opposition and Labor's only hope is that Abbott's unpopularity will, with a lot of help from the Greens, get them over the line. ",39,TimOfAltona

2453,"Agreed. However when you are the PM of a country, the media swarm over every word you utter and you tend to attract more attention than 'any other citizen'. ",30,TimOfAltona
2454,Abbott gave his views on the merits of the ABC's decision to give this Mullah fellow a platform in the first place and again when they stuffed up by re-broadcasting the original 'error of judgement' as Mark Scott had originally labelled it.  ,44,TimOfAltona
2455,"The ABC, as the national broadcaster has an obligation to serve the interests of Australia and Australians - they are not in the business as media platform for individuals who engage in criminal anti-Australian activities or propaganda - which is exactly where Scott's admission of the 'error of judgement' came in. ",52,TimOfAltona
2456,Plenty of other Australian media outlets have given Mullah plenty of airtime or copy to spread his message. The Guardian even gave him his own front page opinion piece.  ,31,TimOfAltona
2457,"We have not heard the PM or Turnbull criticise those media outlets - they are free to run with anything they want - but the tax payer funded ABC, whilst independent, operate under a very different charter from commercial media. ",41,TimOfAltona

2459,"Mark Scott admitted they made a mistake in giving that idiot a platform on Q&amp;A, then they go and replay the broadcast a couple of days later.

2462,"The Australian government, with the support of Labor has got this one right. The boats are no longer arriving, the detention centres are being emptied and closed, children in detention are rapidly decreasing, the drownings have stopped and Australia are welcoming genuine refugees through the controlled UNHCR program. ",49,TimOfAltona
2463,We voted for that in Sept 2013 and the government we elected has delivered on that and more than likely will be re-elected on the same platform come next federal election. ,32,TimOfAltona
2464,"Good luck with that......processing claims for asylum can take years....tens of thousands will still pay people smugglers to get them to Australia, particularly if they think they will be allowed to stay on arrival - another Greens policy I understand.",40,TimOfAltona
2465,"In the absence of that I suggest things are best left with the current government to stop the mass drownings, which is exactly what Australia voted for in Sept 2013 and will vote for again next year.",37,TimOfAltona

2467,Always interesting when the MPs return to their respective sides passing amongst each other following a vote in the lower house - the camaraderie between some of those from the government and those from the opposition is on display. Not a bad thing at all.,45,TimOfAltona
2468,QT is pure theatre - the opposition structure its questions to try and entrap the government knowing they will not elicit a serious or direct answer and the government use the dixers to push their barrow and try and land blows on the opposition. ,45,TimOfAltona
2469,That is what a senate is for - if it does not stack up (according to Labor and the Greens) in current form it won't pass the current senate. Pretty straight forward really.,33,TimOfAltona
2470,"It seems pretty clear to most Australians that if you go off to fight in wars, especially wars against Australia, or engage in terrorism activities there should and will be consequences. ",32,TimOfAltona

2472,I can see the remnants of the Labor/Greens cheer squad all hopping on their soap boxes this morning as they witness the prospect of their party getting back into government (well for the next 2 or 3 terms at least) getting even more remote. ,45,TimOfAltona
2473,"There is a valid reason for that...until Labor and the Greens can present a  alternative government to the Australian people, not just sitting around hoping an unpopular PM will deliver them office, then they have little prospect. ",39,TimOfAltona
2474,"While the dysfunction continues down at team Labor, Abbott continues to easily wedge the ALP and comes out on top time and time again.

2475,"Reality is they are not. We saw the rampant dysfunction during the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years and Labor went ahead a in a bizarre move, inserted a fellow who was a major player/instigator of all that dysfunction as their new leader. ",40,TimOfAltona
2476,Labor's reform and rebuild has barely begun. It starts with sorting out the leadership debacle and getting a team in who are at least electable in the minds of voters.,30,TimOfAltona
2477,"Fair comment, but Australia would not be the trail blazers here - NZ have gone through 2 increases to 15% over recent years with minimal adverse impact, in fact the Key government was returned with an increased majority after raising the GST to 15% and NZ's economy (which does not enjoy the mining revenues Australia has) is in great shape. ",61,TimOfAltona
2478,"Forget the GST carve up, just raise the bloody thing to 12.5%, still exempt fresh food, and hey presto our states suddenly have plenty more dosh to fund schools, hospitals, roads and other infrastructure in addition our budget situation is looking a whole lot better. ",46,TimOfAltona
2479,"Only an LNP government would take a GST increase to an election, Labor are all at sea when it comes to fiscal reform plus their ideology is a roadblock, but the ALP will certainly back it if the government gets a mandate. ",43,TimOfAltona

2485,"So you are perfectly comfortable, if you have young children, to allow them to play and hang out with these children who have been witnessing and participating in (at the behest of their father) beheadings, carrying around severed heads and god knows what other atrocities? ",46,TimOfAltona
2486,"This is a huge problem as to how these children can be integrated back into Australian schools, muslim or otherwise. A change of identity might assist, counselling might assist, but the risks are huge.",34,TimOfAltona
2487,"Don't get too excited people, until these two are positively confirmed dead, there is a strong probability this is a setup. Plenty of people before them have faked their own deaths in an attempt to come back to Australia or some other country under a different identity to avoid capture.",50,TimOfAltona
2488,"Typical of the Labor/Greens cheer squad -a massive void exists when it comes to who should replace - Labor are all but ruled out through dysfunction and lack of leadership, so we all wait with anticipation.",36,TimOfAltona
2489,"Problem with that proposition is that a vote for the Greens is a vote for Labor, always has been - in fact so irrelevant are the Labor party in current day politics that they have no hope of ever returning to government without the help of the Greens. ",49,TimOfAltona
2490,Funny how Clive was the darling of the leftie set when they thought he was causing trouble for the government only to be an instant pariah once they realised Clive had conned them by lulling them into a false sense of security. LOL. ,44,TimOfAltona
2491,Have nothing against unions..there is a definite and constructive place for them in our country...what I don't like are corrupt union executives and officials who rip off their members for personal benefit and use stand over tactics with employers &amp; routinely protected when the ALP are in government. It takes an LNP government to flush them out...the old adage..the LNP is the best friend workers ever had rings very true.,70,TimOfAltona
2492,Labor would test the patience of any speaker....if they actually stopped ignoring the 2 or 3 warnings to STFU from the Speaker they would not be thrown out at the rate they are. Only have themselves to blame. The Speaker is doing an admirable job IMHO.,46,TimOfAltona
2493,"Also, the Speaker made a big mistake in overturning her decision to boot Dreyfus out....Labor MPs are like lemmings and they will all start staying put when thrown out under 94A, hoping Bishop will allow then to stay - more mayhem and childish antics from the Labor party as they continue on their path to remaining in opposition for years to come IMHO.",63,TimOfAltona

2502,Plibersek is hopeless. Whoever is scripting this rank amateur wannabe foreign minister is leading her up the garden path and in her naivety she's taken the bait. This obvious crass political posturing can come back and backfire on Plibersek and Labor big time..and it will. ,46,TimOfAltona
2503,"You completely missed yesterday's thread on why Shorten is a liability for Labor and should be replaced...funny, going by the hundreds of comments it seems not only the Guardian columnists but the majority of Labor supporters were calling for him to go too.

2509,"Lets make one thing perfectly clear, this boat was yet another attempt by the people smugglers to create a new business model, this time boats to NZ, after the Australian government shut down their boats to Australia model which had been operating so successfully under the Labor/Greens government.  ",50,TimOfAltona
2510,How the left get regularly sucked in by and happily play into the hands of the people smugglers is a clear signal that a Labor/Greens government cannot be trusted with Australian maritime border security. ,35,TimOfAltona
2511,"Best Indonesia sort out the rampant corruption which allows maritime people smugglers to operate. Noone gives a shit whether or not Australia handed over a few dollars to turn the boats around - the main thing is the boats have been stopped, the drownings have stopped and that's what we all voted for at the last election.  ",59,TimOfAltona
2512,Nicely poetic...Labor's problems are much deeper than just leadership dysfunction. The ongoing tension between the left and the right is constantly bubbling away below the surface...take asylum seekers as a prime example...the ALP are unable to offer any kind on policy statement on this because the left and right will never agree . The left will lean towards the Greens and the right will lean towards the government where they think the votes will lie. ,76,TimOfAltona
2513,"Albo is genuinely a good bloke, a real warrior for the left of the ALP and I agree, he would be streets ahead of Shorten as leader. However, that's as good as it gets, he is not PM material. Labor need to find another leader who has Albo in his/her corner as Deputy and mentor.",55,TimOfAltona
2514,"Labor are crumbling before our very eyes. Shorten has more baggage on him than a Samsonite dealers convention....Labor's in a tight spot, they want to get rid of Shorten, but given the revelations coming out of The Killing Season on the ABC at the moment, know that voters won't forgive another leadership knifing so they are in a real bind.

2518,"Well, perhaps if labor were good enough the media may decide that they are worth a go. Labor, with Shorten as leader are miles away from looking anything like a viable alternative government at the moment...maybe something positive will come out of the national conference, maybe not.",47,TimOfAltona

2520,"There is a massive difference, Shorten is viewed as a key player in the removal of a sitting Labor PM, not once, but twice and then he goes on to lead the party himself.",34,TimOfAltona
2521,"The Killing Season on the ABC will most likely snuff out any serious move to replace Shorten. Knifing yet another leader so soon after the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd debacle will pretty much ensure Labor will be viewed as a political rabble unable to get their own house in order. They need to stick with Shorten through to the next election and give him every opportunity to deliver.....if he fails to deliver, then he will step down and an orderly transition to a new leader will occur.",84,TimOfAltona
2522,"Not at all. I have always said and believed Turnbull would make a better PM for the country. Not alone on that one, I know many Labor and Greens supporters who would be tempted to back a Turnbull lead government over what Labor have to offer right now. ",49,TimOfAltona

2524,Abbott is right....Labor will be doing plenty of embarrassed laughing in weeks to come. The noose is slowly closing around Shorten's neck...I don't know one person who thinks he can survive to the next election.......you only have to look at this article in today's Guardian...... ,46,TimOfAltona

2527,"Good to see the hapless Plibersek slapped down in QT. God, she is such a liability for the current Labor party front bench. The sooner she and Shorten are jettisoned from the leadership team the sooner Labor can start the rebuild. In the meantime, mediocrity rules.",46,TimOfAltona
2528,Gillard did that at the behest of John McTernan hoping it may dig her out of the bloody great hole she made for herself. What you didn't see was the earpiece hidden under her hair with a direct line back to McTernan scripting her. ,45,TimOfAltona
2529,Perhaps a combination of the two events will assist Labor combat their inner demons and seriously address reform before it's too late? The conference may be a good starting point but could easily turn into a shit fight if the left don't get their way on border protection and asylum seekers.,51,TimOfAltona
2530,Problem for Labor is they make themselves a big target by refusing to acknowledge they have a massive problem. If Dreyfus believes Shorten has unified the Labor Party he's living in lala land.,33,TimOfAltona
2531,"Yes, the walls certainly seem to be closing in on Shorten and Labor. Perhaps the ALP may want to consider reform as good course of action, otherwise it's looking like a very slippery slope they are headed for right now. ",41,TimOfAltona
2532,"As much as the Labor/Greens want the boats to start up again, this government is too strong. The boats have stopped arriving, the people smugglers are all but out of business, the detention centres are being emptied out, children in detention are reducing each week and no one is drowning trying to reach Australia. A great result - but it has taken a long time to clean up Labor's mess.  ",72,TimOfAltona

2542,Labor suddenly stopped asking questions on the subject today because it surfaced that they may have been doing in government exactly what they were accusing the government of the day before. ,32,TimOfAltona
2543,C'mon Daisy we all know Gillard was being heavily scripted by McTernan at that time. It was his tactic to play the misogyny card to try and reverse her failing popularity and framed her speeches to see if it would work for her. Plenty of gullible people were sucked in because they wanted to believe it. ,57,TimOfAltona
2544,Perhaps Julia should suggest John McTernan heads over to the US to assist Hillary's campaign. He can advise her on how to best play the sexism card to try and gain a sympathy vote as he did with Julia's campaign to hold onto the ALP leadership.,46,TimOfAltona

We do not broadcast to people smugglers what we are doing to disrupt their business model.",61,TimOfAltona
2584,Would never have happened under Labor - they totally lost control of our borders.The people smugglers were dictating Australia's immigration intake sending hindreds of boats and tens of thousands of people illegally to Australia. Labor had no idea what to do. That's partly why they are now on the opposition benches and will stay there.,55,TimOfAltona

It is going to happen at some point, so it may as well be an LNP government that receives the accolades and goes in the history books as the government that saw this through.

2625,Morrison will forever be remembered as the man who delivered on the government's promise to stop the boats. There are countless people who are alive today that can thank Morrison for disrupting the people smugglers operation and in turn prevented them boarding leaky boats and heading for Australia. To echo what the majority of Australians say - well done Scott Morrison.,61,TimOfAltona

So Josh really can't win either way can he? ,63,TimOfAltona
2640,If you want anyone to blame for Sydney's overinflated house prices and those in some pockets of Melbourne then look no further than the RBA and their bizarre decision to slash the cash rate to 2 percent or about 50 basis points below Australia's core inflation rate. ,48,TimOfAltona

Because they know if they start up with Israel it's all over ...Israel have zero tolerance to attacks of any kind and have the military might to squash Daesh like a bug...I would dearly love to see Daesh start prodding Israel and then we all stand back and watch them all but wiped out. On second thoughts not a bad idea.",81,TimOfAltona

2667,I think it's a case that Labor in their morning tactical meetings with their advisors are electing to target the lowest hanging fruit of the day....in my view wasting time trying to score quick political points off trivial stuff that often backfires on them - like the small business bill yesterday. You are right there are much more important issues up in the stratosphere that need to be focussed on.,70,TimOfAltona

2692,They would test the patience of any Speaker. Trying to yell out over the top of the PM or Minister providing an answer seems to be the modus operandi of the Shorten administration. ,34,TimOfAltona
2693,"No question with comments like yours the people smugglers are hoping and praying another Labor/Greens government surfaces in this country so they can continue their deadly trade. Not talking about one or two boats every few months, but hundreds a week laden with thousands of people, all at risk of drowning as we saw during the last Labor/Greens administration.",59,TimOfAltona
2694,"No, I just think there is a lot more you can add to the debate than purely focusing on the media - that is only one dimension to this - there are dozens of other factors that determine the fortunes of a government or an opposition.",46,TimOfAltona
2695,Take a look at a map of Australia and you will see that the boats have to go around the Australian coast to reach NZ - the most direct route takes them through Australian waters. No surprise they will be intercepted..,41,TimOfAltona
2696,Give it a rest for God's sake. The dozens of repetitive and often incomprehensible anti-media posts dozens of times a day in the Guardian is wearing a little thin IMHO. ,31,TimOfAltona
2697,Australian activists are readily sucked in by new ploys by people smugglers to try and construct a new business after their Labor inspired model was destroyed by the Abbott government - this time it's 'We are going to NZ but if Australia picks us up along the way then so be it' ,53,TimOfAltona
2698,"I said earlier she may have been a good person with the best intentions for education, but that does not translate into a good leader for the state and there are strong parallels between Kirner and Gillard, both coming in to try and stabilise an inept and dying Labor government and both failing spectacularly. The only difference was that Kirner did not knife John Cain to get the gig.He fell on his own sword. ",75,TimOfAltona
2699,She was wheeled in to try and prop up a failing Labor government after the shambles that were the John Cain years and try as she might her two short years as Premier was marked by incompetence in managing the state's financial affairs (the Labor Way we have come to know). Her failure to cut spending and addicted to borrowing soon saw the state's interest bill skyrocket to billions of dollars a year. ,74,TimOfAltona
2700,"There are parallels with her government and that of Julia Gillard - both women were wheeled in to try and reverse a very sick and sorry labor party and both women failed dismally and lead their parties to landslide defeats, Gillard indirectly.",42,TimOfAltona
2701,"Corey Bernardi - Hang on, is this the man the Labor/Greens cheer squad would have us believe sits further to the right than the Grand Dragon of the KKK? ",30,TimOfAltona
2702,I won't hold my breath waiting for the barrage of labor supporters attacking the credibility of the poll - we will have to wait until the poll shows the opposite ie Coalition 53% and Labor 47% later this year before the Labor supporters decree the poll is rigged and nothing more than a media conspiracy to destroy Labor. LOL.,59,TimOfAltona
2703,Yes I remember vividly the McTernan script parroted by Gillard that day. Had everyone fooled for a good 10 minutes before we realised they were not her words at all.,30,TimOfAltona
2704,You and I both know that's a load of crap Daisy. The government benches do have their moments but are on the whole are fairly silent in comparison. You need to go and sit in the chamber and you'll see what I mean. ,44,TimOfAltona
2705,"I recall with fondness when Gillard was PM that whenever a suspension of standing orders was raised by the LNP in opposition ,all you would see is a flash of red hair as she bolted out the door so she didn't have to face the truth about her incompetence from the opposition. ",53,TimOfAltona
2706,You should go and sit in the public gallery sometime - you can hardly hear what is being said above the cacophony emanating from the Labor side - it starts on the first question.,34,TimOfAltona
2707,"Serious question, why do Labor pull stunts like the dissent motion knowing they have piddly numbers in the House and is pre-programmed to fail? All it does is waste time and distract from real issues that need attention.",38,TimOfAltona
2708,You only have to sit in the chamber during QT and witness Labor MP's yelling out across the House like an unruly mob. Some of them are serial offenders and get themselves kicked out more than others. What part of a warning from the chair do they not understand - yet they persist after 2 or 3 warnings and get turfed out. ,63,TimOfAltona
2709,"Here's a tip - take notice - same sex marriage legislation will go through the Australian parliament and it will be a Coalition government that champions it, not some pretender Labor opposition leader trying to score a few points for himself and his lame duck party.",46,TimOfAltona
2710,Shorten is only pursuing the Same Sex Marriage issue this week because he thinks he'll gain political mileage out of it...his timing is terrible..but I think he knows that..it's all about wedge politics.,33,TimOfAltona
2711,2. You know that this is pure political opportunism by Shorten - he is setting himself up to fail to try and and score cheap political points. There are processes to achieve this which are owned by the government of the day and will ensure passage goes through. Shorten &amp; Plibersek are playing wedge politics pure and simple.,58,TimOfAltona
2712,"With all due respect to Tania Plibersek, she is so out of her depth when it comes to foreign affairs and relations that she is standing on the ocean floor. ",31,TimOfAltona
2713,This is all about wedge politics from Labor - the smirking image of Plibersek at the top of the thread is cringeworthy...she knows exactly what she is doing here and it could well backfire on her. Let's hope it does.,40,TimOfAltona
2714,"Why do these Socialist Alliance activists who demand and expect freedom to publicly demonstrate and express their views always try and shut down or silence, often using violence and intimidation, those who hold different views. ",36,TimOfAltona
2715,"Here is the problem, one person in these threads posts some inaccurate allegation/assertion, then the rest join in and before you know it has transformed into fact Labor/Greens cheer squad land. ",32,TimOfAltona
2716,"Is this the same Newspoll that is highly accurate and  reflects the views of Australian voters when it returns a result with Labor &amp;/or Shorten as the preferred party/leader to govern this country yet in the blink of an eye, morphs into a Murdoch conspiracy, totally fudged, total crap and should be treated with the utter contempt it serves whenever it shows the LNP and/or Abbott gaining ground or ahead? ",72,TimOfAltona
2717,"There appears to be major confusion here....going by many comments many seem to think that ministers personally open, read and respond to every letter that is addressed to him/her or their department..that's roughly how many thousands of letters each week? ",41,TimOfAltona
2718,They were yelling out across the benches and after being warned to stop two or three times they kept on yelling out. I'm starting to think it's intentional (getting thrown out that is)..Shorten needs to exercise more control.,38,TimOfAltona
2719,Spot on Ian - Shorten is only interested in wedge politics trying to score cheap points over largely irrelevant topics...there are much larger issues to pursue....both sides are equally to blame - LNP were no different in opposition.,38,TimOfAltona
2720,We have never seen such an out of control rabble as the ALP in this current parliament....everyone of them gets thrown out after deliberately ignoring the often multiple warnings from the Speaker and continue to yell out across the chamber. ,41,TimOfAltona
2721,I mean we know they have bugger all members left in the lower house but yelling out and ranting will not make it look as if they have more than there actually are. That is determined at the ballot box. ,41,TimOfAltona
2722,Here's a tip for Shorten as leader and the Labor MPs' in his flock - tone it down a bit in the House and you won't be thrown out so regularly. ,32,TimOfAltona
2723,"He is trying to wedge the government, as opposition leaders do, but he is also mindful of the upcoming ALP national conference and he knows this issue has the potential to very publicly destabilise the conference. ",37,TimOfAltona
2724,Two very entertaining spectator spectacles coming soon to a TV near you - grab your popcorn and tune into the ALP National conference in July and on the ABC next week The Killing Fields starring Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard....about the rapid demise of the modern day Labor party. ,50,TimOfAltona
2725,We should be thankful in Australia that the government here has shut down the activities of the people smugglers who were putting people onto leaky boats and pointing them towards Australia - over 1000 drowned before the people smugglers were put out of action.,44,TimOfAltona
2726,"The Killing Season..a 3 part doco by the brilliant Sarah Ferguson on the inside story behind the destructive civil wars between Gillard and Rudd that tore the heart and soul out of the Labor party and relegated them to a handful of seats in the lower house, not to mention stuck in opposition for god knows how many years.  ",61,TimOfAltona
2727,"C'mon Daisy, you and I both know that is not true - that old manufactured line was tried ages ago when Gillard was parroting McTernan to try and get a boost for her in the polls. ",37,TimOfAltona
2728,I notice in the thread above everyone thrown out under 94A is chronicled and often a photo is posted up of the offending member departing the chamber - seems to get the labor cheer squad all in a tizzl and screeching how unfair that so many of their brothers (+sisters) are turfed out by the evil Madame Speaker. ,59,TimOfAltona
2729,What the thread omits is what preceded the turfing out - 90% of the time the member has continued yelling out across the chamber after 2 or 3 warnings by the speaker or they have deliberately done something against the rules of the house which gives them an auto turf out. ,52,TimOfAltona
2730,"It's almost as if the recalcitrant Labor mob see some kind of status or honour in being thrown out on a regular basis - perhaps there are bets on to see who can get thrown out the most, either way not a good look for them and they are not doing their constituents any good by being repeatedly ejected from the chamber.",62,TimOfAltona
2731,I'm with you - Labor need to stop acting like primary school children and return a little decorum to the place. We know they are on the back foot but they don't need to compensate for that by acting up in parliament QT.,43,TimOfAltona
2732,"Here's a hint for you - the minister does not determine whether a person is stripped of dual nationality by reading tea leaves at the bottom of a cup or even off the back of a corn flakes box - perhaps that is the Labor way, but in this case the minister is advised by all the government intelligence agencies involved in determining a person's activity/status and what activities they have been engaged in which have the potential to remove their Australian citizenship. Sometimes you just have to trust the government we elected to guard the security of this nation.",100,TimOfAltona
2733,In fact Daisy is a very good example of why the ALP are losing ground...refuses to listen to any criticism or acknowledge there is a problem and thinks all they have to do is focus on Abbott and they will sneak into government. ,44,TimOfAltona
2734,"The bigger story sitting in this article is that Labor continue to lose more ground....no surprises there.....it was clear as day that after the civil war raging during the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years tearing the party apart and the subsequent 2013 thrashing handed out by the electorate, that Labor needed a major overhaul and rebuild to win back the trust and support of not only it's traditional blue collar supporter base but also middle Australia. ",74,TimOfAltona
2735,"The right install their man against the wishes of party members who overwhelmingly backed another candidate and the bloke installed, who carries more baggage than a Samsonite trade fair, just sits on his hands firing off the odd inane zinger in the general direction of the government and hopes an unpopular PM will be his passport to slip into the Lodge in 2016 just by being there. ",68,TimOfAltona
2736,In my view Labor's rebuilding has barely begun.....I suspect the national conference will expose some old wounds and perhaps publicly reignite the simmering tension between left and right...but it should be used as a platform to firstly recognise that federal Labor today is largely unelectable and that sitting around hoping that a seemingly unpopular PM and Green preferences is not enough to get them back into government. ,68,TimOfAltona
2737,"Reality is, despite the polls which provide false hope (as they did in the UK recently), the LNP are on track to remain in government for another term, with or without Abbott as leader and for good reason.  ",40,TimOfAltona
2738,If people living in this country are not up to anything illegal or engaging in activities that would do harm to fellow Australians then they have nothing to fear. ,30,TimOfAltona
2739,"It would be interesting to determine which one holds 'Top Ranking'...perhaps a matter of personal choice, but I would probably vote The Peninsula Hong Kong (original part) in the top two.",31,TimOfAltona
2740,So you preferred the time when hundreds of boats were heading towards Australia laden with people and tragically so many sunk and thousands drowned...you seriously want to return to those dark days??? ,33,TimOfAltona
2741,"If not, then take heed of what the government has done to prevent that - stopping the boats by destroying the people smugglers business model - no product to sell, no customers, no boats, no one goes into offshore processing centres ( &amp; eventually closed down) and importantly, no one drowns.",51,TimOfAltona
2742,They needed to be processed to ascertain their situation....many people getting on these boats destroy their ID documents to thwart authorities in the hope they get a favourable outcome. ,30,TimOfAltona
2743,You do have a point there..but you also need to consider what preceded each throw out...the Labor MP concerned was either continuing to yell out after being warned by the Speaker or deliberately did something against house rules and was ejected. ,42,TimOfAltona
2744,Labor ask questions framed in such a way as they don't seriously expect a serious answer from the government and the government ask questions of themselves which are nothing more than party political broadcasts. ,35,TimOfAltona
2745,"Here's a tip Joe...if you don't support the current government and you don't support the ALP..you have buckleys chance of supporting anyone who will ever be in government in this country...the Greens may be able to fashion together some kind of government with Labor in 100 years time or so, but 'till then there ain't much out there for you 'fraid to say.",63,TimOfAltona
2746,You do realise that your obsession with the NAZI party in Germany 70 or 80 years ago looks a little unhinged....your lot are not in government for a very good reason...trust. ,32,TimOfAltona
2747,"After the debacle of the last Labor/Greens government, voters do not trust Labor and still don't..Labor have a long way to go before they even look like winning that trust back IMHO.",32,TimOfAltona
2748,I see Hockey is doing a solo on Q&amp;A tonight. Good on him....no doubt the Labor/Greens cheer squadders in the audience have their set pieces all lined up.  ,30,TimOfAltona
2749,Both sides are equally to blame...witnessing either Abbott or Gillard actually give a straight answer is a rare occurrence &amp; nigh impossible and the Dixers are nothing more than a party political broadcast - again both sides are equally culpable in that respect.,43,TimOfAltona
2750,"This is a big part of Labor's problems at the moment, they are fairly weak and ineffectual performers in parliament....insipid leadership and apart from one or two a seemingly washed out front bench. ",34,TimOfAltona
2751,Not too sure why the Labor/Greens cheer squad are siding with the foreign fighters....can only assume they dislike anything that may make this government look good even if it means sympathising with foreign fighters who may want to return. ,40,TimOfAltona
2752,"Something tells me however, that should a 'foreign fighter' return here and the worst happens, the Labor/Greens cheer squad will screeching from the rooftops that it is all Tony Abbott's fault for allowing it to happen under his watch. ",40,TimOfAltona
2753,I'm confused...yesterday there was a Courier Mail commissioned poll showing the federal LNP were improving in QLD and the Labor/Greens cheer squad  into the thread to attack the poll was nothing more than a Courier Mail/Murdoch conspiracy ...yet today a Courier Mail commissioned poll shows QLD state Labor is looking good and not a peep from the Labor/Greens cheer squad about the integrity of the poll. ,68,TimOfAltona
2754,"There are around 100 million waiting behind them, also economic migrants who 'need help' - how about Australia sends a flotilla of cruise ships and all the Qantas aircraft up to Dhaka and start bringing them back to Australia Nene. Will that make you happy?  ",47,TimOfAltona
2755,Morrison is correct about the Rohingyas...he has been to their camps in Burma and seen the extent of the problem himself and the issue is far deeper than a few click bait headlines in the Guardian aimed at getting the anti-Morrison keyboard crusaders frothing at the mouth. ,48,TimOfAltona
2756,"Going by many of the comments in this thread, I suspect Labor voters are fast realising 2016 is beyond them, irrespective of who will lead the LNP to the election.  ",32,TimOfAltona
2757,As the polls start showing the LNP in front everywhere perhaps Labor will wake up and realise that just drifting to the next election hoping an unpopular PM will let them fall into government is delusional. ,37,TimOfAltona
2758,"Actually, you are wrong..the budget has been received pretty well out in the community - only bitter and twisted Labor supporters don't seem to like it, but that is to be expected. ",33,TimOfAltona
2759,"A hostile senate is not good for good governance...shame the LNP can't have a majority in both houses to push through the fiscal reform measures and then allow the voters to mark their scorecard at next years election.....if they have performed they will be returned, if not out they go and Labor/Greens government have a turn once again...",58,TimOfAltona
2760,"You are entitled to your opinion, just as much as I am, and in my opinion you occupy a minority grouping over this issue. The world are looking to Australia for guidance on how to stop thousands of people drowning in the oceans. ",44,TimOfAltona
2761,"The answer is simple - remove the people smugglers business model which stops the boats and the drownings cease. Fairly simple equation, lost on the anti-Abbott brigade that loiter in these threads hoping for support from other members of their minority group.",42,TimOfAltona
2762,The people smugglers must be just hanging out hoping another weak and indecisive Labor/Greens government somehow falls across the line and gives them back their business model to restart their lucrative yet deadly trade.,34,TimOfAltona
2763,An LA based friend of mine in the industry often used to lament that when she hit 30 the roles &amp; offers started to dry up noticeably. She had been quite active in both TV and movie roles up 'till then. ,42,TimOfAltona
2764,"We are yet to hear from just one of the 'Abbott is evil' and 'Let 'em all come here' cheer squad explain what we should do after we take the current boat loads of asylum seekers and then the next wave of boats appear, followed by the next wave, followed by the next wave and the next and the next and the next and the next in perpetuity.....for that is what you will be starting by giving the people smugglers a product to sell and also allowing people smugglers to dictate our immigration policy (as Labor allowed them to do under Rudd and Gillard) not to mention the thousands who may tragically drown along the way all because Australia put the sugar out on the table. ",127,TimOfAltona
2765,"Also, you need to factor in the billions of dollars it will cost the economy to support taking in the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers trying to get to Australia. ",32,TimOfAltona
2766,Allowing your country to be a fly in transit point for tens of thousands of people trying to circumvent the orderly UNHCR migration program and then turning a blind eye to people smugglers openly operating in your ports via corrupt Indonesian authorities means you are in no position to dictate to Australia.  ,54,TimOfAltona
2767,I can't help but notice that your comments focus 100% on Tony Abbott and the LNP and that you look the other way when it comes to recognising the parlous state of the party you want to see in government. ,41,TimOfAltona
2768,My suggestion is less venom aimed at Abbott and put some of your energy into rebuilding your shattered party...they won't just fall into government without reform and particularly with Shorten at the helm.,33,TimOfAltona
2769,What political gain? He is doing what we elected him to do - govern the country in the best interests of Australians. That's why he is PM and Shorten is not (and never will be).,35,TimOfAltona
2770,"For the life of me I cannot recall the LNP promising to shut down people smugglers all over the planet Daisy - just in the waters north of Australia where the boats, drownings and human misery was out of control courtesy of Labor. ",44,TimOfAltona
2771,"C'mon Shorten - are you with or against the government's actions and success in turning boats back, shutting down the people smugglers, emptying out the offshore detention centres and saving lives at sea? ",34,TimOfAltona
2772,"Well, it was certainly curtains for the last disaster of a Labor government when they lost control of our maritime borders. Labor and Greens will not be trusted with managing the nation's immigration policies for quite a few years yet, especially when they result in thousands of people losing their lives in the ocean.",54,TimOfAltona
2773,"He's done a pretty good job at stopping drownings between Indonesia and Australia since Operation Sovereign Borders came into effect - remind me again, how many hundreds/thousands were drowning on the voyage between Indonesia and Australia when Labor lost total control of our maritime borders?",45,TimOfAltona
2774,"I think what many in the Labor/Greens cheer squad don't understand is that as soon as Australia starts offering transport and settlement in Australia for these refugees, hey presto, the people smugglers are provided with a viable business model and the flood gates open, encouraging thousands more to take to leaky boats hoping they too can end up in Australia. Many more drownings result. ",65,TimOfAltona
2775,We already witnessed this when the Rudd Labor government gave the people smugglers a viable operating business model out of Indonesia and we all know the result of that little disaster - the current government is still trying to deal with it.,42,TimOfAltona
2776,I smell a rat....Gambia are asking for the international community to donate to their humanitarian gesture. You gotta ask the question...how much of that money would actually reach the people for which it is intended and how much reaches the personal offshore bank accounts of members of the ruling political party?? ,52,TimOfAltona
2777,"It's a good thing to have a diversity of opinion within a government - provided it's a positive contribution, which Sharman Stone and Arthur Sinodinos comments are. They assist shape policy and ideas. ",34,TimOfAltona
2778,"But David,who is going to pay for your socialist utopia where everyone is supported by the state and gets everything for free. Where does the money come from?  ",30,TimOfAltona
2779,Labor believed in the mythical money tree where all you had to do was keep borrowing and everything will be alright and look what happened there. That's partly why they were thrown out so spectacularly in the last election. ,40,TimOfAltona
2780,Nothing wrong whatsoever in Abbott's comments - there is plenty of dead wood in the ranks of the long term unemployed...no employer wants to be saddled with a hopeless/deadshit employee.... at least this gives the employee a month to demonstrate they are capable of fulfilling the role for which they will be paid and also satisfy the employer they are worthy of being retained. A win-win at any examination.,69,TimOfAltona
2781,Not a bad idea - there are many dead shits in amongst the long term unemployed and it is often difficult to get rid of an under performing employee and in the meantime damage is being done. ,38,TimOfAltona
2782,"Let's not forget that after a kneejerk reaction by the hapless Gillard Labor government, perhaps under the guise of another of her famous 'errors of judgement', Labor crippled our live animal export trade to Indonesia.  ",37,TimOfAltona
2783,For Australia to go up there and start SAR operations in other countries jurisdiction serves nothing more than provide the Burmese people smugglers with a perfect operating business model....... we push you out to sea and Australia will come up and collect you. How many millions of Rohingya are looking to relocate from Myanmar? ,55,TimOfAltona
2784,These are two different situations - our navy turned them back to Indonesia where it was safe to do so...these people have been given extra provisions and sent back out to sea by neighbouring countries. Important to get the facts right in these situations.,44,TimOfAltona
2785,...and the boats will reach the Philippines how? Unless the Philippines navy go out and actually locate these boats thousands of kms away not much chance of them actually getting to the Philippines.,33,TimOfAltona
2786,"Actually, i think you will find it was the Labor government who set up and managed contracts for these centres...how quickly the Labor cheer squad forget the sins of their party.",31,TimOfAltona
2787,"Good thing we have an LNP government in control as this will happen sooner under an LNP government - all Labor achieved, apart from opening the centres up in the first place, was to keep filling them up because they totally lost control of our borders. ",47,TimOfAltona
2788,"Your response is a beautiful example of why federal Labor will fail for years to come - ignoring the 'elephants in the room' and pretending everything is hunky dory will only see Labor amble along, going no where and continue to lose support from it's traditional base. ",48,TimOfAltona
2789,"The huge elephant in the room is Labor's position on people smuggling and asylum seekers. As far as you can make out through the smoke screens, Shorten is basically saying 'me too' when it comes to dealing with this issue, in that he supports the governments efforts to stamp out the trade. At some point voters will expect Labor to provide a comprehensive statement/policy (costed of course) as to how Labor will deal with this issue if they were to return to government. Until Labor shows its hand on this topic, you can forget any opinion polls that show Labor ahead. ",102,TimOfAltona
2790,"In my view, Labors greatest error in judgement over the past year has been to sit back, adopt a small target strategy and hope and pray they can win back office off the back of an unpopular PM just by 'being there'. ",43,TimOfAltona
2791,Labor need to ditch Shorten and Plibersek (they are the 'old' Labor left over from the disaster for Labor that were the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years) as they carry far too much negative baggage. ,33,TimOfAltona
2792,Labor have far better performers sitting on the back bench (&amp; I don't mean Swanny) who could take the party forward with a view to winning back government in 2019 or 2022. ,33,TimOfAltona
2793,Not too many fitted machine guns on the two boats donated to Malaysia that I can see - perhaps just a figment of your imagination comrade?  are important here.,30,TimOfAltona
2794,If you knew anything about SAR you would know that there are clearly defined maritime SAR zones - Australia has a designated territory which does not extend to thousands of kms to our north where some half dozen or so other countries have SAR jurisdiction/responsibility. ,46,TimOfAltona
2795,"Nothing gets the Labor/Greens cheer squad frothing at the mouth more than a Guardian headline that contains the words 'Boats' &amp; 'Abbott'.....I suspect this is because this is a key electoral issue and very likely to keep Labor and the Greens out of government for years to come....that aside, extending the often hysterical hyperbole to include linking migrant smuggler boats leaving ports all around the world to Tony Abbott is at best fanciful and at worst a little unhinged IMHO.",80,TimOfAltona
2796,That's a new one from the cheer squad - the Australian government is now responsible for the actions of all other countries who take steps to stamp out people smuggling and stop mass drownings at sea and any loss of life is all down to Tony Abbott. ,48,TimOfAltona
2797,The left lost this argument a long time ago and were thrashed at the last election partly because Labor screwed up big time and could not be trusted to deal with this issue. Nothing much has changed. ,38,TimOfAltona
2798,The Labor/Greens cheer squad would be wise to remember that they will never be returned to government in this country while they promote giving people smugglers their insidious business model back. Just the way it is IMHO.,37,TimOfAltona
2799,"You may be a bit confused. The government has shut down the people smugglers operating out of Indonesia. As effective as this government is, it has no influence with boats departing Burma nor North Africa for that matter, as much as some of the more unhinged Labor/Greens cheer squad are trying, blaming Tony Abbott for the drownings in the Med is a little bizarre IMHO.",65,TimOfAltona
2800,I'm confused...if he did nothing you will mercilessly attack for doing nothing and when he actually takes concrete steps to protect the reef you mercilessly attack him for taking action to protect the reef...anyone else confused?,36,TimOfAltona
2801,Good initiative - anything that reduces the risk of assault or worse by abusive partners or other family members is a welcome move...let's hope the states support this federal government initiative.,31,TimOfAltona
2802,"Perhaps you need to start thinking a bit more laterally, there is a whole different world outside your Labor prism - ignoring it and pretending that Labor are capable of winning next year by doing nothing is, with respect, delusional. ",41,TimOfAltona
2803,"The ALP are getting worried...they were caught off guard by the budget last week and now given they are totally unprepared for an early election I think the verb ""rattled"" is good descriptor of Labor right now.",37,TimOfAltona
2804,This is not a great scenario...good thing the boats have stopped arriving so that the centres are not continually being filled up with new arrivals as they were under Labor. ,31,TimOfAltona
2805,"Labor under Rudd stuffed up big time on this issue and by the time they realised public opinion was heavily against them, they desperately tried to reverse the policy...it was all too late and Abbott came in on a landslide victory. ",42,TimOfAltona
2806,Just between you and me Daisy it is not only the Liberal Party gearing up to get the boot into Shorten.....the left of the Labor Party are lining up to insert the proverbial knife in the back.....along with most Australian voters if he is still leader come the next federal election.,51,TimOfAltona
2807,"Yep, NSW is a fine example of which you speak. The tide is turning...people remember what it is like under Labor - NSW woke up and rejected the inept ALP....the same thing will happen federally.",35,TimOfAltona
2808,The tide of public opinion is turning.....Labor have been exposed...void of any economic credentials apart from very good at borrowing from overseas to pay for all their extravagant and un-costed policies.....voters will not trust a Labor/Greens government with the keys to the country's cash register for quite some years to come IMHO.,52,TimOfAltona
2809,Forget pro-LNP Textor - if Labor were good enough they can win...herein lies your problem...the ALP are years away from reform and rebuilding themselves into a viable alternative government...until they do no amount of spin from the ALP factions will work...it is  that's needed and this is where Labor fall over time and time again.,56,TimOfAltona
2810,"The challenge Labor had after the drubbing in Sept 2013 was to rebuild, re-invigorate, sort out dysfunctional and factional leadership wars and sort out if they are in or out of bed with the Greens and also distance themselves from Trades Hall to appeal to more mainstream voters. ",49,TimOfAltona
2811,"The reality is that it will always ever be the two major parties governing the country, although Labor have form when it comes to selling their soul to the Greens for political expediency...but even the Greens can't save Labor in the foreseeable future.",43,TimOfAltona
2812,"Nothing like the words 'US Military', ''B1 Bomber' and 'Abbott' in a headline to get the red neck Labor/Greens supporters lighting their flaming torches, grabbing their pitchforks, constructing their Abbott/US Flag effigies and marching towards the gates of parliament en masse.",41,TimOfAltona
2813,Shorten's speech (we await to discover who wrote it for him) was predictable as it was desperate. Desperate because Labor have been wedged beautifully......the government had the audacity to present the kind of budget only a Labor government could have produced and it has the ALP rattled.,47,TimOfAltona
2814,If you think that Gallery were just a bunch of people who happened to turn up because they were interested in politics then you are sorely deluded....the Gallery was stacked with a Labor rent a crowd from the ACTU programmed to applaud at specific points of Shortens speech. ,49,TimOfAltona
2815,"That's one way of looking at it - the other way is that Shorten has no idea what he's doing, he has been outsmarted and desperately trying to recover lost ground....some say it's too little too late.  ",39,TimOfAltona
2816,Josh has done nothing wrong here - it was in the rules and tens of thousands of others have done the same. The govt is working towards rectifying the situation. Nothing to see here.,34,TimOfAltona
2817,Well the choice is clear...throwing a few million at the corrupt Central African Republic regime or funding tax breaks for our farmers to assist them build fences and building up their water retention infrastructure?  ,36,TimOfAltona
2818,Bill had better perform tonight - leadership on the line and all that - will be interesting which great Labor luminary he is parroting tonight. Last year he was scripted by Keating and Kelty...wonder if they are doing the honours again tonight? ,43,TimOfAltona
2819,You only have to look at the polling in the UK to prove that polls mean jack shit - the only poll that counts is on election day (to borrow a well used phrase) ,35,TimOfAltona
2820,The ALP are deluding themselves if they think all they have to do is 'be there' to win an election. Won't happen and they will be thrashed just as UK Labour were last week.,34,TimOfAltona
2821,I did and it was a pleasure being to there to experience a resounding win to the conservatives. There are clear parallels between UK Labour and the ALP...both have weak leaders and are seen as increasingly irrelevant in the political sphere. Voters in both countries know it is conservative governments who are the better economic managers hence UK Labour were kicked out of the ball park and the same will happen again to the ALP unless they speed up their internal reform along with getting their (unelectable) leadership dysfunction sorted.,90,TimOfAltona
2822,At any examination you have to say that Bronwyn Bishop is doing a great job in controlling the Labor rabble - more should be thrown out to drive the message home - carrying on like recalcitrant primary school children is not the behaviour we want to see in parliament.  ,51,TimOfAltona
2823,"If Labor are seriously looking to count themselves in the running next year, they need to modify their behaviour - it will take a lot more than Greens preferences for them to get over the line. ",37,TimOfAltona
2824,"No, the context was about successful female state leaders of the Labor Party. I was just pointing out that Kirner, Bligh and Kenneally were anything but successful for Labor, in fact the reverse and I threw Gillard into the mix for good measure.",43,TimOfAltona
2825,"Mate, seriously, it's time to give up on this anti-media crusade of yours. It's getting boring beyond belief with dozens of daily posts about media conspiracies and going on for months and months now and I reckon there are a fair few Labor supporters who would agree with me. ",50,TimOfAltona
2826,No idea Daisy - depends on whether it is any good or not - let's keep our eyes peeled and see if we can spot Abbott applauding Shorten's speech. ,30,TimOfAltona
2827,Given what happened to the first 3 I would not try and claim this as any kind of Labor positive...the first 3 were absolute disasters for Labor in the end (along with Gillard). The jury is still out on the 4th.,41,TimOfAltona
2828,Touchy touchy Michael. We all recognise and acknowledge that Shorten has a predilection towards zingers - in fact he is renowned for it on a daily basis - that fact coupled with the phrase 'a most excellent school' has nothing whatsoever to do with what you are pushing. ,49,TimOfAltona
2829,Back on Budget night in the chamber - could not help but notice that Bill Shorten was applauding Hockey after the budget speech - clapping his hands along with the government members and those up in the public gallery. ,40,TimOfAltona
2830,Interesting - perhaps it's the 'done thing' for the LOTTO to congratulate the Treasurer on his budget delivery speech or perhaps he was just in agreement that it was a bloody good budget. ,34,TimOfAltona
2831,"I see the Abbott budget has got you a bit rattled...I'm with you though, thousands of more votes going to the LNP from the tens of thousands of tradies out there who know a good deal when they see one.",40,TimOfAltona
2832,The NBN was Labor's great folly - all pre-election smoke and mirrors hidden in reports buried somewhere on Albo's desk - never did lay his hands on those reports before the election did he? ,35,TimOfAltona
2833,As an aside...what's the betting like on Albo/Plibersek and the left making a move on Shorten and the right? Betting money at the moment is on Plibbers sharpening the knives in the Labor party room silverware drawer. I could not think of a greater gift to the LNP if the hapless Plibersek gets the gig- a very weak performer in parliament....Albo on the other hand would be a greater challenge IMHO.,71,TimOfAltona
2834,Good delivery by Hockey at the Press Club lunch - one of his better addresses in some time. At times he appears washed out and tired...looks like he has good energy today off the back of a increasingly well recieved budget. All good.,43,TimOfAltona
2835,"'This is an unfair budget' they squawk....'last year's was unfair but this year it's even unfairer..how dare this conservative government hand down a budget that is straight out an ALP government copybook...I mean...it's so fair that it's unfair because it makes the government look like they have moved back towards the centre and that means a certain victory for the LNP up against our weak, dysfunctional and insipid(leadership) Labor party next year...even Greens preferences won't save us ' they moan despairingly. ",82,TimOfAltona
2836,"Good to see a tick of approval from this cartoonist fellow. See, life ain't that bad under a Liberal government.....might even do some good if those damn recalcitrant Greens didn't keep blocking everything in the senate.",36,TimOfAltona
2837,"Looks like Hockey's budget has the Labor cheer squad well and truly rattled....clearly this budget will be pretty well received throughout the community...particularly small business, farmers, parents and pensioners. Labor supporters were hoping for more of the same from last year and they have been bitterly disappointed. ",48,TimOfAltona
2838,Well we all fondly remember who was writing all Julia Gillard's stuff don't we Daisy? Went on for over a year. No wonder she crashed and burned so spectacularly in the end.,32,TimOfAltona
2839,"Crap - it's happening all over the world..not just in Australia. Just this year look at France, look at the UK, look the USA, look at Belgium, look at the Netherlands, look at Germany, look at Malaysia..the list goes on. Muslim youth are being radicalised via social media and internet around the planet...nothing to do what political leaders in Australia may have said. Political leaders in all these countries speak out against terror acts, the causes and possible solutions.",79,TimOfAltona
2840,Bill Kelty and Paul Keating in case you did not know - all Shorten did was parrot their words - as I said Labor have all sorts of problems ahead with Shorten there.,33,TimOfAltona
2841,"Daisy, Daisy, Daisy - I think you know I have plenty of positive things to say about my own side - it's just that Shorten is getting weaker and weaker as each day goes by and I could not rely on any of you to point that fact out, now could I?  ",54,TimOfAltona
2842,"As in Australia, bitter and twisted Labour/Labor supporters want to point the finger of blame at everyone else for their stunning respective defeats without confronting the reality of the situation - if their own party was good enough and up to it when it comes to leadership, vision and policies that mainstream voters can relate to, then victory is there for the taking.  ",65,TimOfAltona
2843,There is enough social media spinning around to counter any other media pushing for one party or the other. In both countries Murdoch has backed Labour in the past when he thought they were up to it. ,38,TimOfAltona
2844,"Surprising as it may sound and given the relatively vacuous state the ALP are in, I would like to see Abbott or his successor sit down with Di Natale and have a frank discussion on where the country is heading and how it may look in 20, 30 or even 50 years time. ",54,TimOfAltona
2845,"The Greens can bring some constructive dialogue to the table and sure, they won't get a lot of what they want in the short to medium term but only good can come from opening dialogue and sharing ideas and proposed solutions - small steps and ultimately, irrespective of ideology differences, we are all working towards protecting and improving on what makes Australia great now and for future generations. ",69,TimOfAltona
2846,"It's how we manage the economic, social and environmental challenges along the way that is contentious. Negotiation and reasonable compromise is the key to success, particularly in the senate. ",30,TimOfAltona
2847,"Perhaps improved collaboration between the Greens &amp; the LNP will see a less fractured &amp; poisonous political landscape emerge and given the events of the past 8 years or so, that is not such a bad thing.",37,TimOfAltona
2848,Shorten hoping he can just glide into Kirribilli House propped up by Green preferences &amp; off the back of a Liberal Party leader even more unpopular than himself is delusional.  ,32,TimOfAltona
2849,You get the distinct feeling things are getting back on track for the government. The electorate can smell the factional dysfunction and obvious weaknesses in the Labor camp...not ready to govern for quite a few years yet - at least not until they jettison Shorten and sort out if it's the left or the right running the show.,58,TimOfAltona
2850,"I'm with you, it's high time those people who perpetrated those atrocities in colonial Australia in the 19th century are tracked down and brought before the courts as soon as possible. The death sentence should be applied where it is applicable.",41,TimOfAltona
2851,"The refugees can stay there as long as they like - particularly so if they are Muslim. The difference between the two countries is that in Australia they go on welfare and in Indonesia there is no welfare for them, they have to live off existing savings or find jobs or go home.",53,TimOfAltona
2852,"The government are not sending them back to Iraq etc etc - they are being returned to where they came from, Indonesia. They are perfectly safe there as they would be had they come to Australia - just without the welfare support.",42,TimOfAltona
2853,"Marles also said in the same Sky interview, omitted by the journo here, that labor will do everything possible to prevent boats departing Java again, including regional processing...hmmmmm...sounds like an endorsement of the governments policies.",35,TimOfAltona
2854,"You must be confused - there are no rapes, torture, executions,imprisonment and disappearances of those waiting in Indonesia to get on people smuggler boats to come to Australia.  ",30,TimOfAltona
2855,"Well Marles would say that wouldn't he, this from the man who presided for a time where Australia completely lost control of our borders coupled with the mass drownings that accompanied that dark period in Australia's history.",37,TimOfAltona
2856,"When Abbott arrived in Paris he was travelling solo, protocol dictates that the Australian Ambassador therefore meets and greets the PM at the airport solo. Had Margie been with Abbott then the Ambassadors partner, male or female, will accompany the Ambassador at the airport greeting. ",46,TimOfAltona
2857,Did the article also report that Abbott had dinner hat night with the Ambassador and his partner in Paris just as they had done back in Australia before Abbott went to Europe? ,33,TimOfAltona
2858,This story is misleading...why did the journo not also report that Marles also said in the interview that if Labor were in power they would likewise do everything possible to stop boats departing Java and that the regional processing centres in PNG and Nauru were Labor's initiative which has worked and not the governments. ,55,TimOfAltona
2859,"Yeah right, there has been infighting going on for months, primarily around leadership.Looks like the anti-Milne camp have succeeded. Anyone who resigns to ""spend more time with their family"" is a metaphor for you know what.",36,TimOfAltona
2860,Labor will be watching this with keen interest to see who will be leading their coalition partner into next years election. Hard to pick between the top 3 contenders but more likely it will be a male.,37,TimOfAltona
2861,Good to see the previous government left the states finances in good shape with a healthy surplus. Now watch labor wreck the joint just as they did when they took over federally from Howard.,34,TimOfAltona
2862,Good outcome. The left hate this kind of story as it shows the government's election promise is being upheld. Encouraging people to get on leaky boats to reach Australia is cruel and often leads to mass drownings.,37,TimOfAltona
2863,"I see the Labor/Greens cheer squad are getting a tad nervous - the last thing they want right now, on top of the looming Labor factional leadership wars, is for the government to hand down a budget which is perceived to be fair and reasonable compared to the last one and considering the fall in commodity prices is a pretty good effort to try and keep the economy moving. ",70,TimOfAltona
2864,The house is in perfect order...there is a PM regaining popularity and a very popular successor if Abbott goes. It's all over for Labor for another two terms at least if Turnbull takes the government into the next election particularly as Labor's factional wars come to the surface in coming weeks. All good.,53,TimOfAltona
2865,"When will the Labor/Greens cheer squad wake up to the fact that Shorten is unelectable.....not only do the conservative and Greens voters not want him, half or more of his own party don't want him as leader. ",38,TimOfAltona
2866,Labor are still in a rebuilding phase and have made little progress since the disasters of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years. You need to sort out the leadership dysfunction first...I think everyone knows that Albo is the only credible leader who can take Labor forward and give them a fighting chance in 2019.,51,TimOfAltona
2867,The Rudd experiment on this issue was a dismal failure - that we know...if Shorten proposes to soften the current policy which gives the people smugglers their business model back - all hell will break loose...and is certain to keep the Labor/Greens coalition on the opposition benches for years and years to come. ,54,TimOfAltona
2868,There is a way to stop the thousands of deaths at sea in the Mediterranean - stop the boats departing Nth Africa by shutting down the people smugglers . Try it - it works.,34,TimOfAltona
2869,"These boys, thinking the risk was worth it, knowingly and willingly played with fire and ended up getting horribly burnt. They are the ones ultimately to blame for this outcome, sad as it is. ",35,TimOfAltona
2870,Actually defence is an area where massive savings can be made - ditch the submarines I say - I cannot see how Australia maintaining a naval submarine fleet benefits the country? ,32,TimOfAltona
2871,Perhaps it was their addiction to borrowing coupled with dysfunctional leadership over the 6 years that distracted Labor from addressing the much needed Australian tax reform...either that or were they were just protecting the top 10%?,36,TimOfAltona
2872,"Perhaps if Labor chose a policy they have some semblance of achieving it may look good on their score card but this is nothing but rhetoric, complete and utter rubbish, waste of time and zero will come of it - I think we all recognise that from the outset. Political opportunism pure and simple.",54,TimOfAltona
2873,"So the ALP are about to embark on a crusade to wipe out the death penalty around the globe - hmmmm let's see, that would be China, about 20 states in the USA, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, India plus another 17 odd countries all of whom are still executing people who break certain laws, primarily for murder. ",60,TimOfAltona
2874,"A little bit of trivia - of the roughly 35,000 McDonalds restaurants around the globe, only two in the world are housed in original stand alone art deco buildings - one is in Napier, the other in Melbourne Australia.",39,TimOfAltona
2875,"Shut em down I say - if they can't be self sufficient then time to withdraw taxpayer support and allow these people to move into larger communities where sufficient services and infrastructure exist and also allows more opportunity to get jobs, provide education for children and better health care.",49,TimOfAltona
2876,"My my, so many of the Labor/Greens cheer squad are walking around with massive chips on their shoulders it seems - here's a tip pal, we don't think Labor are to blame for everything - just some things. This particular issue occurred when Labor were in govt, but it is not necessarily their 'fault'. ASIO operate within the legislation/guidelines of the day and there is clearly more to this story.",70,TimOfAltona
2877,"You are right but I suspect that in a matter of only 3 or 4 weeks the events of the past 24 hrs will be distant memory and we all move on, including tens of thousands of Australians booking their flights and hotels for holidays in Bali.",47,TimOfAltona
2878,There were many players in this drama of which a number hold some degree of responsibility for the final outcome - none more so than the two men themselves. ,30,TimOfAltona
2879,"Congratulations, you managed to cover roughly 12 separate issues ranging from beef exports to Antarctic bases to Knighthoods in your rant on a story about the execution of the two Australians.",31,TimOfAltona
2880,"Actually I think you will be wrong - Labor are in no condition to form government - even in partnership with the Greens - The LNP will be returned, albeit with reduced number of seats in the lower house.",39,TimOfAltona
2881,Should it not be incumbent upon this UN person to also speak with WA or federal government representatives and receive both sides of the story before releasing a public statement? ,31,TimOfAltona
2882,"Australia cannot continue to provide unlimited welfare for people who choose to remain in tiny remote communities where there are no jobs, no schools, few medical facilities, no infrastructure and zero hope for the future apart from living off state and federal government handouts. ",45,TimOfAltona
2883,At some point people have to start taking responsibility for their own futures and not expect the government to keep throwing tax payer money at them to maintain their desire to live in unsustainable remote areas.  ,38,TimOfAltona
2884,Indonesian public opinion favours executing criminals for drug crimes....Widodo went to the election on a promise of being tough on drug criminals - he won't back down for fear of being deemed weak.,33,TimOfAltona
2885,"I was in Place de la Rpublique in Paris a couple of days ago where there was a very large public demonstration, similar to the ones we saw in Australia for Chan and Sukumaran, against the imminent execution of Frenchman Serge Atlaoui but interestingly there were also photos of Chan and Sukumaran being held up in the crowd......Atlaoui appears to have a legitimate alibi which may reverse his execution sentence and a few hours later we hear he will not be executed pending another appeal......a glimmer of hope that at least 1 of these 10 will not be executed.",99,TimOfAltona
2886,Only if you work for a large public media organisation and on ANZAC day very publicly accuse deceased Australian soldiers as being murderers and rapists - other than that I think you are fairly safe.,35,TimOfAltona
2887,"Right here is the problem with so many people making comments in these threads, they say anything and make things up as they go along to try and prosecute their case.",31,TimOfAltona
2888,He breached the conduct code of the organisation he was employed by.....there have to be consequences and there were. He exercised his right to make offensive comments the consequences of which meant his employment was terminated. ,37,TimOfAltona
2889,It's called Freedom of Speech comrade. Wanting to shut down views expressed by the right and only hear views expressed by the left has already been experimented with in Cuba and Venezuela - things have not turned out too well in either of those two countries IMHO.,47,TimOfAltona
2890,You seem to be confused over this issue - when you work for a large public organisation you are required to sign and agree to a code of conduct as a condition of your continued employment. When you breech that conduct code and go on to deliberately flout the code of conduct despite warnings - there are consequences. ,59,TimOfAltona
2891,"You are absolutely correct - he is entitled to his opinions as are you or I - however when you are a reasonably high profile media identity working for a large public broadcasting entity, choosing to call deceased Australian troops on Anzac Day, murderers and rapists will have it's consequences.....and not unreasonably so. ",54,TimOfAltona
2892,He is an intelligent fellow who must feel very strongly about this issue in that he was prepared to throw himself under the proverbial bus to express his views....or maybe not.,31,TimOfAltona
2893,After reading McIntyre's comments you have to ask the question - did he really think he would have kept his job in a major public media organisation after tweeting those offensive remarks - on ANZAC day of all days? ,40,TimOfAltona
2894,"Those of the left may be happy to see the offshore detention centres continue to operate whilst the LNP are in government, but I suspect the LNP will achieve what Howard did when he was in government - close them down.",41,TimOfAltona
2895,"Well of course they would, but your argument is a nonsense because we don't have these boats crashing into rocks on our shoreline anymore because the government have shut down the people smuggler operations. Everyone wins.",36,TimOfAltona
2896,"A very good thing these kind of events, think Christmas Island here, are a thing of the past since Labor and the Greens were booted out of government in Australia in 2013. ",33,TimOfAltona
2897, The left don't like it or a whole number of reasons......... and I would never suggest that the left condone people drowning at sea...however I do look forward to the day when someone from the Labor/Greens cheer squad concedes that it is a good thing that we have effectively stopped the mass drownings occurring in the seas between SE Asia and Australia because the people smugglers business model has been disrupted and boats are no longer leaving in their hundreds each month bound for Australia.,86,TimOfAltona
2898,"Anybody would think, reading comments in this thread, that Sydney has never experienced heavy hail before and you would also think that, according to the cheer squad for Labor and the Greens, that this event is god's punishment for us voting in a conservative government. ",46,TimOfAltona
2899, It follows that if a Labor/Greens government were still in power this event would have happened because Tony Abbott is destroying the planet with severe weather events never seen before in the past 200 years. ,37,TimOfAltona
2900,"I am in Paris currently, and I would dearly love to invite the Australian Labor/Greens cheer squad members so indignant and damning of the Australian government policy on immigration to take a walk with me through some of the migrant suburbs (ghettos) here in Paris where even the police are highly cautious about entering.The result of  migration, most of it from Africa. (albeit France allows people from former French colonies to join relatives in France)  You feel for these people...but what a disaster for the economic and social cohesion of many French urban areas where migration is out of control. Lessons indeed for Australia.",106,TimOfAltona
2901,"You need a reality check pal. migration from Africa to Europe cannot continue without serious negative social and economic consequences, starting with thousands of people drowning in the oceans along the way.",32,TimOfAltona
2902,What a sensationalist and misleading headline. David Marr employing a little poetic licence perhaps? I don't see anywhere where Farage says Tony Abbott is too tough on immigration. He in fact says the opposite and has praised Abbott for showing European leaders how to deal with the boats from Africa.  ,52,TimOfAltona
2903,"That may be so - have not seen any data around that supports your claim, but my point is attempting to link Australia's teen suicide rate with detention of asylum seekers is a nonsense.... NZ has a far higher rate of teenage suicide per head of population than Australia and NZ don't even have asylum seeker families in detention. The two issues, whilst complex, are entirely separate.",67,TimOfAltona
2904,"errr...not really. Thankfully, Australia is quite a way down the list..........NZ is way ahead of Australia as are many other 'western' countries. Attempting to link these two subjects is meaningless.",30,TimOfAltona
2905,"Yes, pave the way and encourage tens of thousands more to try and make the voyage by sea and send hundreds or thousands more to their death by drowning. ",30,TimOfAltona
2906,The last Labor/Greens government in Australia gave the insidious people smugglers a working business model with the same results we are seeing in the Mediterranean ie: people drowning in their thousands.,31,TimOfAltona
2907,So far all that has happened is the Dept of Immigration have followed the rules regarding this situation. It is now up to the minister/government to overrule the immigration rules for this case or have it enforced. ,38,TimOfAltona
2908,"Julian Burnside completely ignores the fact that thousands of people have paid with their lives by drowning en route at the hands of people smugglers....what about all these dead men, women and children Burnside...don't they figure in your 'open borders, we should take all comers' utopia? ",47,TimOfAltona
2909,"Well, I for one am proud that Australia has largely shut down the insidious people smuggler trade in this part of the world and quite possibly saved thousands of lives in doing so. ",34,TimOfAltona
2910,"No one likes to see or hear of Australian politicians being investigated for possible criminal acts/activity. Reflects badly on the party, the ALP in this case, and does nothing for the standing of politicians overall.  ",37,TimOfAltona
2911,"I'm with you, we would not want any good to come out of this in case it makes Abbott look good. Let's all hope it is a disaster so we can keep on manufacturing hatred towards Abbott.  ",39,TimOfAltona
2912,"You goose, why would the PM of Australia visiting Turkey not meet with his counterpart to discuss items of mutual interest to both nations? Your problem I suspect is that you only want to see a Labor PM meeting with the Turkish PM. ",44,TimOfAltona
2913,I've notice some commentators in the last couple of days trying to lay the blame for what's happening in the Mediterranean on Tony Abbott. Claiming that he has not stopped the boats due to people drowning in their thousands off the coast of North Africa. ,46,TimOfAltona
2914,"Oh the irony....I think you will find the government will be the first signatory on the petition. No one, including the government want these places operating, hence they are being emptied out as soon as is practicable....only a matter of time and you won't be needing anymore petitions - they will be closed - just like when Howard sorted this out when he was PM.",65,TimOfAltona
2915,"Grubby comments directed at a person's appearance or clothing are best left out of these threads, hence the story is not open for comments...the issue is the good work Bishop is doing in Iran, not what she happens to wear which seems to be the main focus of attention for the Labor/Greens cheer squad IMHO.",55,TimOfAltona
2916,"The article is about thousands of men, women and children drowning at sea and all you want to do is encourage more people onto people smuggler boats to try and make the journey. No wonder your side of politics got thrashed and booted out at the last federal election in Australia.",51,TimOfAltona
2917,"Like so many other apologists for the people smugglers you go into hiding when hundreds of men, women and children drown at sea because you would rather they keep coming just to be able to say Abbott's policies have failed. ",41,TimOfAltona
2918,"Southern Europe need to take a look at the successful Australian model for taking back control of your borders, shutting down the people smuggling operations and preventing wholesale drownings at sea.",31,TimOfAltona
2919,"Funny thing is while they are carrying on blindly attacking Ley for fear this makes the government look good, there is a sentence in the article that goes something like this..... ",32,TimOfAltona
2920,This begs the question - where are UNICEF when dozens of children are drowning at sea after being lured to Australia on people smuggler boats. Where are the UNICEF condemnation of boats departing Indonesia for Australia and where is UNICEF's praise for the Abbott government in preventing the hundreds or perhaps thousands of deaths at sea. ,57,TimOfAltona
2921,"Also, there is nothing that shows the interests or well being of the children and their parents are compromised by going to Cambodia - sounds like Cambodia is immeasurably better than the processing centre in Nauru.",36,TimOfAltona
2922,Proud moment for Julie Bishop and Australia....playing on the world stage with the big boys...Kevin Rudd must be green with envy. Bishop has been impressive with her forays into global events and it's easy to see why she is a contender for leadership of the Liberal Party. ,48,TimOfAltona
2923,Clearly the left feel threatened by such a strong and intelligent woman who is on the conservative side of politics - largely I suspect because their side lacks any female with the calibre of Julie Bishop...Penny Wong probably comes the closest after that the cupboard is bare. Herein lies the problem for the ALP - almost zero depth of talent in their ranks apart from perhaps 5 individuals and only one of those is a female.,76,TimOfAltona
2924,Bishop is shining on the world stage and good on her......your bitterness over losing the 2013 election is on display for all to see. Clearly strong and intelligent conservative women present a clear and present danger for you.....time to pull your head in and acknowledge that Julie Bishop has done a great job as Australia's FM - all you can do is attack the clothes she wears...you were quick to demonise people who criticised Julia Gillard's dress sense and here you are doing exactly the same thing against Bishop? ,90,TimOfAltona
2925,Nobody wins out of that - in fact people get injured and it was a good thing BNE was spared that - as much as the socialist left would have enjoyed the prospect of street battles with the police.,39,TimOfAltona
2926,"Daisy, I really think it's time you pulled your head in on trying to vilify Abbott over the action he is taking on tackling domestic violence - this is above politics, yet you persist in trying to find an angle to try and attack Abbott over this....listen to Daniel Andrews comments this afternoon, he praised Abbott for his leadership over this issue.",62,TimOfAltona
2927,I had not realised until this thread that Rudd is not exactly the poster boy for the Labor cheer squad.....didn't he save some of the furniture for you guys in the 2013 election? ,34,TimOfAltona
2928,Rudd was always going to chase this dream of his to lead the UN.....holding onto the Australian Prime Ministership was the perfect lobbying stepping stone/platform for him to land the top gig at the UN....then disaster struck for him when he lost the 2013 election. ,46,TimOfAltona
2929,Helen Clarke (former Labour PM of NZ) was probably well ahead of Rudd in the pecking for the top job anyway. Don't discount that Clarke could well be the first female UN Secretary General.,34,TimOfAltona
2930,"So, a poster boy for the refugee advocate groups and the Greens who are actively trying to stop people being sent to Nauru is  to put on a show for the asylum seekers the detention centre??? ",38,TimOfAltona
2931,"Chances of a change back to a Labor/Greens government unlikely though - the success of the government's asylum seeker policy and stopping the boats is, on it's own, enough to return the current government IMHO.",35,TimOfAltona
2932,"All boats are either pushed back, towed back or occupants transferred to other boats and returned to Indonesia - people can't reach Australia by boat and if they do, they are transferred to detention centres in other countries in the region - they never get to Australia. ",48,TimOfAltona
2933,Australia has dealt with this issue by denying the people smugglers a viable business model so the customers have stopped handing over money and the asylum seeker boats have stopped departing Indonesia. ,33,TimOfAltona
2934,There is already a regional solution in place under the current government and it has done the job - no more boats arriving in Australia and no more drownings at sea. Soon it will also see no more offshore processing centres as well. Everyone wins.,45,TimOfAltona
2935,My understanding of a Royal Commission is it needs to be initiated by the government of the day so as the LNP and Labor are as one with this it will never happen. ,34,TimOfAltona
2936,Morrison and Dutton are to be congratulated and will be at the ballot box in next years federal election which I suspect is really at the crux of your displeasure over this. .,33,TimOfAltona
2937,Giving asylum seekers who arrive by boat residency in Australia provides the people smugglers with the perfect business model - like the one Labor and the Greens gave them a few years ago. Result - hundreds of people smuggler boats departing Indonesia carrying thousands of asylum seekers with 1000+ drowning along the way. ,54,TimOfAltona
2938,You may be a bit confused about this.....the Australian troops are not going to Iraq to fight anyone..they are going on a mission to assist train Iraqi army recruits in how to defend the country against IS insurgents. There is a big difference. Read the article again.,47,TimOfAltona
2939,It's time the left stopped blaming the media for the inadequacies of their party - time to face up to the fact that the ALP and their Greens partners are in no state to govern the country. ,38,TimOfAltona
2940,"Stop blaming everyone else and try and work out how Labor can reform, rebuild and try and work themselves into a credible alternative government in the years ahead. Start by taking a good hard look at your leader....there is a major problem for you right there in Bill Shorten.",49,TimOfAltona
2941,Glamorpig does want to hear about those things - he is on a mission to vilify the Australian government even if it means he ignores IS atrocities to achieve his aim.,31,TimOfAltona
2942,"Along with the UK, USA, NZ, France, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Jordan, UAE, Bahrain, and Qatar - yep they all bask in giving IS dream coverage by sending support troops. ",30,TimOfAltona
2943,So who is Bill Shorten hiding behind? Labor would be doing the same thing if they were in government. There is a valid reason why we are going on this training mission - presumably you want to see IS defeated? Or maybe not.,43,TimOfAltona
2944,Good to see Labor backing the government on this initiative and a shame Milne is doing her usual pacifist routine even it means allowing IS to continue their genocidal rampage through Syria and Iraq. ,35,TimOfAltona
2945,"A week is a longtime in politics....18 months is a lifetime. The polls will bounce around for Abbott, but no question if Turnbull were to take the leadership, the ALP will be be all but gone - I think the ALP focus groups have already alerted them to that fact, hence Shorten ramping up the anti- Turnbull rhetoric. (Shorten, along with the rest of the ALP know their best chance lies in Abbott holding on to the election) ",79,TimOfAltona
2946,"If Abbott were to hang on, a lot more media scrutiny will be applied to Shorten, what he stands for, how would he perform as PM, what direction would he lead the government, what are his costed policies and where does he stand on red hot contentious issues such as stopping boats, Budget deficits, managing climate change, relationship with the Greens, union control, relationship with Labor's left faction and any past closet skeletons which may emerge. ",77,TimOfAltona
2947,Fair to say the LNP are on track to return to government next year - somewhat easier task if Abbott was to stand aside and allow Turnbull to hop into the driving seat. ,34,TimOfAltona
2948,"I'm with you, we only want to see a Labor government punching above their weight...then again, can you  seriously contemplate Tania Plibersek heading off to Iran to play with the big end of town??? I think not. ",39,TimOfAltona
2949,"The NZ government,both NZ Labour (who originally introduced the GST) and the current conservative government under John Key had the political courage to increase the GST from the original 10%, then 12.5% then 15%. ",35,TimOfAltona
2950,I'm with you - keep following the trail and eventually it will lead to Tony Abbott's office and no doubt the blame for these slogans on rental vans will lie with the PM.,33,TimOfAltona
2951,"Well, as expected the Labor/Greens cheer squad are suddenly all pro-Iranian and hope and pray that Iran will not accept their economic refugees back to Iran...why? Because it is the Abbott government wanting to return economic refugees. ",38,TimOfAltona
2952,Presumably had Abbott announced Iranian economic refugees would all be granted visas to remain permanently in Australia this thread would be choc full of comments attacking the Abbott decision and insisting the economic refugees be returned to Iran. ,39,TimOfAltona
2953,Economic refugees need to go through the proper channels to be allowed to resettle in Australia - not pay people smugglers handsomely and expect Australia to accept them to the detriment of genuine asylum seekers who are going through the UNHCR program.,42,TimOfAltona
2954,There is a limit as to how much longer you can subsidise people who choose to live in tiny communities in remote areas where there are no jobs and little or no services/facilities. ,34,TimOfAltona
2955,Billions of dollars of 'aid' have been poured into indigenous communities (if that is what you are referring to) by successive governments for decades.....not much to show for it. ,30,TimOfAltona
2956,"Now c'mon, I have seen literally thousands of posts in these threads announcing that all Labor have to do is 'be there' in 2016 and they will smash the LNP - irrespective of leader.",34,TimOfAltona
2957,"The problem is the dogs breakfast senate...apart from the usual Labor/Greens cabal, a mish mash of misfits, some of whom sit in the senate after receiving less than 1% of the primary vote...if there was ever a case to overhaul the senate voting/preferencing regulations this current senate is a prime example.",51,TimOfAltona
2958,I often wonder what the ALP relationship with the Greens would be like if Albo was leader...would he embrace them for political survival as the Labor left did under Gillard or would he hold firm on Labor principles and fashion the Labor opposition to stand on their own two feet without doing deals with the Greens to get the ALP over the line? ,64,TimOfAltona
2959,"Seriously, the left need to abandon their bizarre fascination/obsession with events in Europe some 70 years ago to try and prosecute their case. It holds zero relevance to 2015 Australia &amp; totally falls on deaf ears except within their own tiny cabal.",42,TimOfAltona
2960,The left need to abandon this bizarre fascination with a period of history going back some 70 years ago to try and prosecute a case - zero relevance to Australia in 2015.,32,TimOfAltona
2961,"Unfortunately some of these 'asylum' seekers have either negative security assessments against them, or they have found to be non-genuine refugees (ie economic) and they also happen have children with them. The children are there because their parent/s want to keep the family unit together...no easy answer. ",48,TimOfAltona
2962,You deliberately missed the point - we don't need official government reports to know what is going on at sea... there are possibly hundreds of people at the start and end of the journey that are looking out for people departing on boats......social media is a powerful medium ........,49,TimOfAltona
2963,"It is seriously only a matter of time before there are no children in offshore detention, in fact there will be noone in offshre detention and the facilities are closed down. ",32,TimOfAltona
2964,"Before you reply saying how do we know it has stopped? Simple, no boat departs Indonesia without both satellite phone communication plus people both in Indonesia and friends/family/refugee advocates in Australia knowing exactly who has left on that boat....if the boat goes missing or is in distress media and SAR authorities are alerted fairly quickly. There have been no such reports of boats/people missing for a year or more. During the last Labor government boats were being reported missing almost weekly.",81,TimOfAltona
2965,Burnside will twist this around - the people smugglers need to be shut down - Julian will no doubt argue that people smugglers have rights too and argue that they be allowed to continue their trade in transporting people who pay them to enter Australia illegally by sea outside the UNHCR program. ,53,TimOfAltona
2966, - you will need to wait until the next Labor/Greens government is in power before the people smugglers get the required business model to re-start sending hundreds of boats laden with thousands of asylum seekers to Australia along with the associated horrific drownings at sea.,46,TimOfAltona
2967,I'm with you - thousands of asylum seekers are secretly landing on our shores each week and transported off to secret detention centres in the outback. Their boats are secretly destroyed in secret locations. ,35,TimOfAltona
2968,"C'mon Tony, you know as well as I that as soon as Abbott comments on a situation or issue you and your fellow cheer squadders shoot him down in flames for opening his mouth..so I guess it annoys the crap out of you when he says nothing - but you still attack him.....for saying nothing. ",56,TimOfAltona
2969,"The people smuggler boats have stopped arriving laden with asylum seekers, so the good news is that offshore processing centre populations are not increasing...it is now just a matter of time before they are emptied and closed. ",38,TimOfAltona
2970,That all started well before the Coalition came into government - Detroit made the decision when Kim Carr (no pun intended) was Industry Minister. The result would have been the same whether Labor or Liberals won the 2013 election. ,40,TimOfAltona
2971,"Bottom line - Australia cannot compete with the low labour cost in India, China, Malaysia and Thailand...hence many automotive brands are relocating manufacturing to those countries. Australia labour costs are just too high to manufacture motor vehicles....are you listening ACTU????",40,TimOfAltona
2972,I'm confused.....when the Newspoll returns a lead for either Abbott or the LNP these threads are flooded with comments attacking the credibility of the poll and how it's all a Murdoch conspiracy...yet today when the Newspoll shows Shorten and Labor ahead no-one is attacking the credibility or bonafides of the poll...everyone is in lockstep with Newspoll. ,57,TimOfAltona
2973,Targeting Abbott because he took steps as PM to protect Australia from the scourge of radical Islamic extremism only goes to show the ineptness of their argument......a Labor/Greens lead government would be taking the same measures to protect Australians from the threat of global terrorism - it's what we expect our leaders to do.,54,TimOfAltona
2974,"Labor were only able to do that because of the massive surplus gifted to them by the previous government....also congratulations Daisy, you have posted a comment without the words ""Tony"" or ""Abbott"" ...a first??",34,TimOfAltona
2975,"Here's a tip for you.....had the role of HRC commissioner been occupied by a male making the same findings and comments as Triggs, he would have been dealt with in the same way. Gender has nothing to do with it. ",41,TimOfAltona
2976,I'm sure Coles and Woolies would love to get a piece of the action here...probably be good for competition but no good for the small independent chemist shops who need the higher margins to survive.,35,TimOfAltona
2977,"You gotta say, of all the hundreds if not thousands of photos taken at the G20, the Guardian select one of Abbott and Putin holding koalas to headline this story? ",31,TimOfAltona
2978,No one knows because they have adopted a small target tactic in opposition....at some point Shorten will need to be flushed out and reveal his alternative solutions to tax reform...and I don't mean at 10pm on the night before next years federal election.,43,TimOfAltona
2979,"It is inevitable the rate of GST will increase in this country. The report is right, Australia has one of the lowest GST rates in the developed world and in my view this needs correcting. ",36,TimOfAltona
2980,"You only have to look across the Tasman where NZ increased, on a much broader base too, their GST from 10% to 12.5% over the space of a few years, then more recently to 15% under a conservative government lead by John Key who not too long ago was returned to power in a record landslide victory against NZ Labour. ",61,TimOfAltona
2981,"There is a message in this.....the ALP lacks the courage and fortitude to adequately progress Australia's tax reform agenda, particularly the all important GST increase. It will only be under a Liberal government that real tax reform will be achieved in Australia. ",43,TimOfAltona
2982,Perhaps the ALP can take a leaf out of the NZ Labour handbook - Labour introduced GST in NZ in 1986 and then it was a Labour government that increased it to 12.5% in 1989. ,36,TimOfAltona
2983,"If Shorten wants to start making a name for himself and show some leadership he needs to start engaging with the government on tax reform measures and yes, this includes discussion on GST.",33,TimOfAltona
2984,"Good comments by Baird......collaborating with Labor over important reform reflects great leadership by Baird and provided they can get it right, will only result in giving people more confidence and trust in their politicians - from all sides.",38,TimOfAltona
2985,"Labor and their cheer squad would do well to pay more attention to people like Martin Ferguson, Michael Costa and Richo - they tell it like it is and don't Labor luvvies hate that!",34,TimOfAltona
2986,Mate you need to get over your daily obsession with the media....blaming the media for Labor's failures is living in denial that a major overhaul of the ALP brand and policies is required. ,34,TimOfAltona
2987,"Mate, no matter how much lipstick you try to apply to the Labor pig, it is still a pig and they suffered their 2nd biggest loss in NSW since the formation of the ALP in 1891! ",37,TimOfAltona
2988,Sums it up perfectly. Baird has 4 years for him and his team to deliver on his mandated reform measures...if he succeeds Labor have little hope of getting back into NSW for another two terms or more. Great work by Mike Baird!!!,42,TimOfAltona
2989,Blind Freddy could see that there would be a correction in Labor seats after the annihilation of 2011...but surprisingly not as many seats went back to Labor as expected ,30,TimOfAltona
2990,"The party needs some years to rebuild, find direction, sort out leadership and get back to representing grass roots supporters. Shorten will never be a Labor PM. Abbott despite his unpopularity could even beat Shorten next year. ",38,TimOfAltona
2991,I see a magnificent win coming up for the LNP - the ALP were delusional in the extreme thinking NSW voters would trust their state with a Labor/Greens experimental government controlled by the unions. ,35,TimOfAltona
2992,"No, they can see that Labor are just not up to running Australia's largest economy - it's a matter of trust. Come back in 4 years and see if Labor have improved.",32,TimOfAltona
2993,The Labor/Greens cheer squad are getting restless as the reality sinks in they have been backing the losing team....Baird is shaping up to be one of NSW greatest premiers and all the unions could muster for the ALP was an unknown bloke from the left faction. ,47,TimOfAltona
2994,Fortunately that tactic has backfired on them over the leasing of electricity poles and wires during the NSW campaign - their scare tactics have been revealed as bogus and NSW voters have seen through the ALP charade.,37,TimOfAltona
2995,Gladys Berejiklian is an extremely competent minister - she has overseen big improvements in NSW transport and has a big future in NSW government. No doubt she will make a very good treasurer should Mike Baird ask that of her.,40,TimOfAltona
2996,He'll need all the help he can get if he crashes and burns tomorrow - the right faction will be after him and he'll definitely need the force to protect him to hold onto the leadership.,36,TimOfAltona
2997,Who knows what will happen - odds are Baird will be the victor tomorrow...but federally is way open if Turnbull takes the leadership mid-year...which is on the cards if the budget crashes and burns again. ,36,TimOfAltona
2998,"It's a good thing that this is being looked into........it is just wrong that anyone can pay the fee and enter themselves as an independent or minor party senate candidate, receive 0.7% of the vote and be rewarded with a seat in the Australian Senate. In other words, they have not been democratically voted in by the people - but by a logarithm that has allowed a manipulation of the preferencing system courtesy of Glenn Druery. ",77,TimOfAltona
2999,The problem the ALP have is that their key anti-privatisation platform will be found to be bogus once the Baird government get the state moving again with the proceeds of the lease plus power bills have had minimal or no increases due to the leasing. ,46,TimOfAltona
3000,The problem the ALP have is that their key anti-privatisation platform will be found to be bogus once the Baird government get the state moving again with the proceeds of the lease plus power bills have had minimal or no increases due to the leasing. ,46,TimOfAltona
3001,"Blinky Bill laid waste to QT today by engaging in a useless Labor stunt - achieved nothing, completely wasted the final sitting day till May and further eroded Labor's credibility on the eve of the NSW election.",37,TimOfAltona
3002,The Labor cheer squad are claiming the LNP are so on the nose in NSW and federally that Labor will win this in a landslide - you guys can make a killing on this election. ,36,TimOfAltona
3003,The Labor cheer squad are claiming the LNP are so on the nose in NSW and federally that Labor will win this in a landslide - you guys can make a killing on this election. ,36,TimOfAltona
3004,"As I said, the left don't like him because he (&amp; Abbott) succeeded in delivering on one of the election promises that lead to Labor being thrown out of office. You comment confirms this beautifully. Cheers.",36,TimOfAltona
3005,Scott Morrison is actually a very decent fellow. The left don't like him because he delivered on an election promise that saw Labor crushed at the last election.  ,30,TimOfAltona
3006,"In all honesty I can't see the fiscal sense in building and maintaining submarines...what practical use, even from a national security perspective do they have for Australia that existing surface naval vessels can't perform apart from the obvious submerging.  ",41,TimOfAltona
3007,"Billions of dollars put into more worthwhile projects with a greater positive social impact and even dare I say, get the budget back into the black quick smart.  ",30,TimOfAltona
3008,Very inept and inane comment by Plibersek. I guess it was fairly early in the morning but she should have a better line than this one if she wants people to take her seriously as Shadow Foreign Minister. ,39,TimOfAltona
3009,"As much as the Labor/Greens cheer squad get all agitated and excited over this sort of thing I wouldn't read too much into this at all - in fact it is a classic ""Nothing to see here folks"" moment.",39,TimOfAltona
3010,"Very funny. Unless some miracle occurs, I think the chances of Abbott taking the party to the next election are roughly zero. It's only a matter of time. Then the pressure is on Shorten to lift.",36,TimOfAltona
3011,To be fair Daisy - there were quite a few empty seats from time to time on the ALP side of the house as well....must be something in the water in Parliament House that keeps those recalcitrant MP's going to the toilet during condolence motions.,45,TimOfAltona
3012,Good to know NSW will be in good hands for the next 4 years and beyond. Baird certainly deserves another term to allow his government and polices to be implemented and ultimately benefit the state. ,36,TimOfAltona
3013,Given the millions the unions have poured (wasted) into this campaign to try a get Foley across the line - you don't think they would want a return on that investment if by some miracle Foley did fall across the line? ,42,TimOfAltona
3014,Excellent synopsis by David Marr of the man shaping up to be one of the greatest NSW Premiers for many years. The next 4 years should consolidate both his and the LNP position. ,34,TimOfAltona
3015,"The ALP scare campaign over privatisation has been very costly for the unions, pretty much millions of dollars down the drain. Baird is just too strong for anything Labor/unions/Greens can muster.",31,TimOfAltona
3016,I'm with you Daisy - given this was an all day event they should have had bottles beside their seats to pee into rather than disrespectfully leaving and visiting the toilets outside the chamber - only problem is what about the girls? A bit more challenging for them I would have thought. Any suggestions Daisy?,55,TimOfAltona
3017,Both sides need to step up. QLD Labor government are in the box seat to deliver on their pre-election promises just as much as Hunt and the federal government are obligated to act.,33,TimOfAltona
3018,How quickly you overlook the fact that Labor cobbled together a majority of 1 to form government in QLD....yet you don't want to hold them to account when it comes to the Reef - it's all the fault of the party  in government. ,45,TimOfAltona
3019,Last I looked the GBR is in Queensland.......what is the new QLD Labor government doing about this? I distinctly recall this issue formed part of their campaign for election ie We will protect the Reef if elected. ,38,TimOfAltona
3020,"Take heart..Christine Milne was introduced as Leader of the Opposition at the rally in Sydney yesterday, which pretty much supports my assertions of Greens control over Labor of the past few years.  ",34,TimOfAltona
3021,Wrong...it's because Labor are not ready to manage Australia's largest economy yet and voters can see that - excusing it by constantly shooting the messenger will ensure Labor stay in opposition for years to come.,35,TimOfAltona
3022,Good to see all signs pointing to a Baird government win. It was only a couple of weeks ago the Labor cheer squad were announcing a crushing win for the ALP - seems some are still living in that delusional bubble.  ,43,TimOfAltona
3023,"NSW Labor were never really in the race despite all the grubby union bullying tactics, privatisation scare campaign and wheeling Andrews in from VIC in a failed exercise to try and lend some credibility to a largely anonymous NSW ALP leader.  ",43,TimOfAltona
3024,If and when a Labor/Greens government get back in federally and the people smuggler boats start arriving in their hundreds with thousands of passengers along with hundreds or thousands of people drowning again there will be all hell to pay.,40,TimOfAltona
3025,It would be nice for just once for someone from the Labor/Greens cheer squad to admit that Morrison did a bloody good job in stopping the boats and preventing further deaths at sea between Indonesia and Australia. C'mon you can do it!,42,TimOfAltona
3026,I don't think anyone seriously thought the QLD result would be as it was - she is very much the 'Accidental' Premier - that said NSW is a very different situation to QLD with the man who is probably the most popular senior state politician in the country up against a virtual unknown Labor candidate who is struggling to get him self heard or even recognised.  ,68,TimOfAltona
3027,Please provide a link that shows a recent LNP member has been found to be corrupt - I can of course give you a few names from the ALP but I don't think you will find one on the LNP side. ,42,TimOfAltona
3028,Been away for a few days......I see the bookies have LNP at $1.05 and ALP have pushed out to $9.50....clearly NSW are not ready to put their faith back in Labor for another 4 years at least - not surprising given the events during the last NSW Labor govt. ,50,TimOfAltona
3029,Baird is shaping up to be one of NSW greatest Premiers - another four years will hopefully allow his policies to positively affect the state and consolidate his hold on power for future terms.,34,TimOfAltona
3030,I'm with you - the only propaganda we want to read in here is from Labor and Labor alone - anything anyone from the government says should be omitted in its entirety. ,33,TimOfAltona
3031,"Political, social and religious instability are the hallmarks of modern day Egypt, along with massive corruption and human rights abuses........hardly an ideal setting for a project of this scale/complexity requiring capital from foreign investors to make it happen. ",39,TimOfAltona
3032,Not sure why the Labor/Greens cheer squad are so keen for a DD or an early election.....do they think because they are ahead in the polls that will auto translate into a win???? ,34,TimOfAltona
3033,"Newsflash for the cheer squad - Your team ain't that hot at the moment. I don't think the result in QLD where a burnt stick would have taken Labor to victory, will translate into the federal sphere...Labor cannot be trusted on so many fronts and people can see that.",49,TimOfAltona
3034,If Plibersek tries to appease the Greens and pushes ahead with opening up our borders to people smugglers again Labor can forget about getting back into government any time soon.,30,TimOfAltona
3035,...and by Plibersek attacking the boat turnarounds she is sending a message to the people smugglers - !!! (but you'll have to wait until the next Labor/Greens government are in power),31,TimOfAltona
3036,If Labor win - fair to say the pressure on Abbott will be crushing - more than likely end his prime ministership. Even if the LNP are returned but with a vastly reduced majority Abbott will still be under severe pressure. The only outcome to assist Abbott is a strong NSW vote for the LNP with some more seats picked up - possible.,63,TimOfAltona
3037,The polls reflect a cross section of community views at that point of time. Your problem is you only want to see polls that favor Labor and any that don't you label a media conspiracy. ,36,TimOfAltona
3038,"Ignore it if you like, but this is a serious problem for Labor. The Labor right are almost in lockstep with the government on this issue but the left are almost in lockstep with the Greens. ",37,TimOfAltona
3039,At some point you have to accept the reality that Labor are for a number of reasons just not that popular in NSW and NSW voters won't trust them with government for at least another term or two. ,39,TimOfAltona
3040,"Part of Labor's problem is that Baird is shaping up to be one of NSW greatest premiers and the Labor guy, his name escapes me, is almost unkown. It will take that fellow at least another term or two to build a profile.",43,TimOfAltona
3041,The people smugglers are no doubt hoping Labor and the Greens will gift them a working business model with which to re-start their insidious and deadly trade if Labor and the Greens get back into government next year.,38,TimOfAltona
3042,I think even Bernie Banton would acknowledge it was a political stunt on his behalf - albeit for a very good cause - it was a planned media stunt in the midst of the 2007 federal election campaign.,38,TimOfAltona
3043,You may be a bit confused....Tony Abbott is in federal politics and Baird is in state politics and last I looked Abbott was not running for a state seat..check the NSW electoral website if you don't believe me - no mention of Tony Abbott running for a seat in NSW.,50,TimOfAltona
3044,This has to be a one of the best examples of a non-story we've seen for a long long time - I mean how obsessed are these people with Tony Abbott?,31,TimOfAltona
3045,Any chance you can forward the links from Holden to back up your claim (FACT you called it)j that they exited Australian manufacturing as a direct result of the LNP government? ,32,TimOfAltona
3046,Burying your head in the sand and pretending this does not exist is why Labor are in the situation they are in now - you guys need to get your act together with the prospect of a Turnbull lead government bearing down on you.,44,TimOfAltona
3047,I'm with you - we only want Guardian journos who look only at the LNP and completely stay away from any problems in the Labor camp. We wouldn't want people to think Labor are unfit for government or anything would we?,41,TimOfAltona
3048,For very sound reasoning I call it the Labor/Greens cheer squad - for Labor have to bed down with the Greens to form government - can't do it in their own right which opens up a whole can of worms....look at all the grief it caused Gillard over carbon tax. ,51,TimOfAltona
3049,Fair to say the ALP national conference has all the makings of handing the LNP another term next year - particularly if the left get their way and propose to re-start the people smuggling operations out of Indonesia again.,39,TimOfAltona
3050,We are waiting for the Labor infighting to re-emerge. Albo and the left have their sights well and truly on the Labor leadership and Shorten is in the way. ,30,TimOfAltona
3051,"Turnbull has always been my choice for Liberal leader...but prepared to give Abbott a go, benefit of the doubt and all that...but not working out too well as you know. ",31,TimOfAltona

3053,Very good of you to confirm what everyone is thinking - Labor have no alternative policies - at least none they want to release until roughly 10pm on the eve of next years election.,34,TimOfAltona
3054,All the namby pamby latte sipping limp wristed pinot grigio quaffing lefties sitting in their inner city cafes have no idea of the harsh reality of what it is like to live in these tiny remote communities yet immediately jump in to say the government (tax payer) should continue to pay for these people to live there irrespective of the cost.  ,63,TimOfAltona
3055,"Alcoholism, daily domestic violence, sexual assault, children not attending school, almost zero prospect of employment are all rampant in many of these remote communities, yet on ideology grounds the Labor/Greens cheer squad want the government (tax payer)to endlessly fund this cycle of hopelessness and despair. ",46,TimOfAltona
3056,Someone has to pay for that -they can't live there unless taxpayers maintain them - if that's the case we should all go and live for free in rural areas - the government will support us.,36,TimOfAltona
3057,Who is going to pay for people to live on their own land? How much longer will Australian taxpayers have to maintain other Australians who choose to live in remote areas?  ,33,TimOfAltona
3058,Good comment. I don't think many of the people making comments in this thread actually disagree with the substance of what is being conveyed here - it is because the person conveying it is one Tony Abbott that has them frothing at the mouth. ,45,TimOfAltona
3059,Give it a rest you are talking dribble again - the issue here is communities remaining self sufficient and sustainable without relying on tax payers dollars to fund their lifestyle. The fact they may be aboriginal is neither here nor there - they are Australians and no more entitled to a free ride through life than you or I. ,60,TimOfAltona
3060,"I don't know there are any obligations of any government to support people with welfare who choose to live in a particular area, particularly when the cost to maintain those 'lifestyles' is prohibitive. Do you?",35,TimOfAltona
3061,"I don't think you understand the actual communities being discussed here.....these are areas where there are no services, precious few schools if any, no employment or prospect of employment and everyone pretty much live off welfare. ",37,TimOfAltona
3062,"Abbott is right when he says the cycle must be broken - we are living in the 21st century, this is not Australia 200 years ago. People living in these communities need to be given the opportunity to provide a good upbringing for their children, care properly for the elderly and importantly have jobs to support themselves.",57,TimOfAltona
3063,"Actually you are wrong - indigenous people won't improve their situation by living off welfare and other government handouts for the rest of their lives. The level of alcoholism, domestic violence and sexual assault is many times higher in remote communities living off welfare - breaking the cycle of hopelessness and despair is the best way for people to improve their situation and become contributing members of the community.",69,TimOfAltona
3064,Actually Abbott does make a valid point - people who choose to live in a particular location but only if the government (tax payer) pays for everything so they can live there are not contributing - free loaders?,38,TimOfAltona
3065,"In the meantime thousands of men, women and children from minority communities are being murdered - but the namby pamby limp wristed latte sippers sitting in their cosy inner city cafes are saying - nothing to see here folks - if we ignore it it will just go away. Leftie dickheads.",51,TimOfAltona

3068,"Problem is, it has to be paid for and unlike Labor who borrow billions to cover unfunded policies, the government will need to find savings elsewhere..herein lies the challenge...Labor spectacularly failed in this area...let's see what this government can do.",40,TimOfAltona

3071,Greer's comment to Bishop about Bishop baring her breasts in public to save the condemned Australians in Indonesia was crass and undignified. At a wild guess I would think that will be Greer's last appearance on a Q &amp; A panel.,41,TimOfAltona

3074,Julie Bishop was very good on Q&amp;A - along with the other panelists clearly a very intelligent and articulate person. No one can really fault the good work she has been doing as Australia's first female Foreign Minister. You can easily see why many would like to see her become PM one day.,53,TimOfAltona
3075,"Actually I found it refreshing not have some female ALP person on the panel attempting to turn it into a political catfight. Julie Bishop did a great job representing the female political voice, she said nothing that a female Labor politician would not have also have expressed. ",48,TimOfAltona
3076,"We stand a pretty good chance of getting a seat at the HRC table..apart from the current kerfuffle, Australia has a proud history of standing up for the sanctity of life irrespective of the political party in government - like it or not Abbott's recent lobbying and public and private appeals to Widodo over Indonesian death sentencing has gained worldwide recognition and will no doubt be looked upon favourably by the HRC committee.",73,TimOfAltona
3077,"Apart from the people on the boat themselves, they have relatives/friends on shore monitoring their departure and awaiting their arrival in Australia who will raise the alarm, in addition there are refugee advocates along with friends and relatives in Australia aware of the journey and awaiting word of their arrival who will also raise the alarm if the boat disappears. Most of these boats have satellite phones with direct access to both Australian search and rescue and refugee advocates and even media in Australia....it is highly unlikely/improbable a boat will simply disappear and we hear nothing more about it without the alarm being raised through the media or refugee advocates.",110,TimOfAltona
3078,I will have a lot more confidence in the UN when I see the UNHCR acknowledging that Australia has played a major role in preventing helpless people perishing at sea. ,31,TimOfAltona
3079,Take a look at what's happening between North Africa and southern Europe where there are zero border controls - hundreds of thousands trying to get to Europe by people smuggler boats and thousands perishing at sea along the way. The UN should be zeroing in on that human catastrophe.,49,TimOfAltona
3080,The UN is NOT the messenger - they are the accuser based on untested allegations by people who paid people smugglers to get them to Australia and had that ripped away from them.,33,TimOfAltona
3081,errr...the allegations are they were going to join IS in Iraq or Syria...I somehow suspect that would have been a little more damaging to their lives than being stopped at Sydney airport and sent home with their Mum and Dad.,40,TimOfAltona

3083,"I thought at the time under the circumstances and given their ages a court appearance notice would have been a little premature - there will need to be a fairly extensive investigation into what these two were up to, if anything, before anti-terrorism charges would be laid. ",48,TimOfAltona
3084,"That said, some 'material' was alleged to have been found in their possession which lead Customs to suspect they may be in contravention of Australia's Foreign Fighters legislation - presumably more information will be revealed in coming weeks and maybe charges laid.",42,TimOfAltona

3086,No need to be frightened of a GST increase - it will happen sooner or later - might even be a Labor/Greens government that does just that in a few years time when they have run up a trillion dollars of debt for the nation.,45,TimOfAltona
3087,Nice try comrade. NSW voters are not ready to install an inept Labor/Greens party into government. Too much damage over the 16 years. By all accounts Baird is doing a great job in NSW and constantly has the highest preferred leader ratings in opinion polls for Liberal or Labor party Australia-wide. ,52,TimOfAltona

3089,As unpopular as Abbott is with the Labor/Greens cheer squad and certainly within some quarters of his own camp - didn't he do a resounding slap down of the hapless Shorten in QT last week over the Tattersalls Men Only club event. ,43,TimOfAltona
3090,Here was Shorten thinking he was going to wedge the PM and the whole thing backfired spectacularly on Shorten and his inept front bench - the look on Plibersek and Kate Ellis's face when they realised Abbott had stymied them was priceless.  ,44,TimOfAltona

3092,"So I assume you want to to see the people smugglers have free reign to send hundreds of boats with thousands of asylum seekers to Australia - in effect letting them control our borders along with our immigration policy and possibly thousands drowning along the way (as we have seen here under the Rudd/Gillard debacles and occurring in Nth Africa today), then I would assert you are creating a massive political disadvantage, not to mention the billions of extra dollars this country will need to find because of uncontrolled borders to supply housing, health care, feeding, education and general welfare. ",101,TimOfAltona
3093,Those are the lifejackets the Australian authorities supplied them when they were intercepted. If you think people smugglers are operating some kind of pleasure cruise handing out life jackets to their customers you are terribly naive. ,37,TimOfAltona
3094,Thinking you can regulate insidious people smuggler operators again shows your gross naivety on this subject. These are people running criminal operations which kill hundreds of people and make the operators very wealthy.  ,35,TimOfAltona

3098,The headline to this story is misleading - the government have said no such thing - only PAC (Independent Statutory Authority) &amp; Rio Tinto have made comment. The government is yet to respond. ,34,TimOfAltona

3100,"This morning on Sky Graham Richardson, the doyen of the Labor Party, came out in support of Abbott raising the issue of Australia's generous disaster relief assistance being consistent with our values when it comes to opposing the death penalty...Richardson believed the PM was quite correct in raising that point.

3102,I truly suspect the coalition government returned in 2016 will not look and have the same feel about it as we have at present. A new leader and some front bench rearranging along with policy adjustments will be all that's needed to keep a potentially woeful Labor/Greens government out of office for another term or two IMHO.,57,TimOfAltona
3103,Last I looked Manus and Nauru are not staring down the barrel of a world heritage endangered listing - in any case they are territories of other sovereign nations. ,30,TimOfAltona
3104,Put aside the shrill hysterics of the Labor/Greens cheer squad and you will soon see there is only so much money to go around and there would always be some who would miss out. ,35,TimOfAltona
3105,The sooner the Labor cheer squad come to terms with the reality that there is not a bottomless pit of money (ie the days of Labor borrowing billions each week are over)the sooner we can get on with fixing the nation's debt crisis IMHO.,44,TimOfAltona

3108,Speaking of the Northern Territory - who can forget that magical moment during the 2013 federal election campaign when Kevin Rudd rocked into Darwin and announced a special NT Economic Zone?? ,32,TimOfAltona
3109,I think you may be a bit confused. It is not the federal government holding an event at Tattersalls. It is the QLD state LNP and they are not in government last I looked. ,35,TimOfAltona
3110,"Pure click-bait which readily attracts the usual swarm of Labor cheer squad devotees who look for anything, manufactured or otherwise, that may detract from the failings and dysfunction of their own party. ",33,TimOfAltona

3112,"There is every excuse to stop taking unauthorised maritime arrivals. Hundreds, if not thousands, perish at sea trying to get to Australia. That has stopped since this government shut down the people smugglers. ",34,TimOfAltona
3113,"But as the world changes so must we change the way we do  things. That does not mean we will ever stop trying to eliminate domestic violence, high rates of aboriginal incarceration, or mass refugee drownings at sea. In fact there are plenty of practical steps and programs/initiatives being taken to address those specific problems.  ",58,TimOfAltona
3114,As Australians we believe in a fair go and readily support others in need. Our refugee intake via the UNHCR program is one of the most generous in the world as is our readiness to help neighbours in times of crisis such as natural disasters. ,46,TimOfAltona
3115,"Here's the thing...if the Libs are as bad as you make out and Labor are as good as you make out, then NSW voters will reward Labor with government....if Labor are not yet up to the task of governing Australia's largest economy then they will remain in opposition for another 4 years - which is almost certain. ",58,TimOfAltona
3116,I am no fan of Indonesia....it shits me that both Liberal and Labor governments kowtow to one of the most corrupt nations on the planet...you only have to look at past events in East Timor and what amounts to genocide perpetrated by the Indonesian government occupiers of West Papua to see that Indonesia is not the 'good neighbour' successive Labor and Liberal governments have portrayed.  ,67,TimOfAltona
3117,Labor have a long long way to go before they are in any shape to return to government in this country. A complete overhaul of the ALP is sorely needed. ,31,TimOfAltona
3118,I think you may be confused.....it is the senate that is blocking all this.....no point the government flogging it if a recalcitrant senate is intent on blocking reform measures along ideology lines. ,33,TimOfAltona
3119,"It's a crying shame that this government, or indeed previous Liberal and Labor governments, have never applied the same amount of outrage towards Indonesia over the atrocities in Indonesian occupied West Papua. ",33,TimOfAltona
3120,"Turning a blind eye to the regular murders, rapes and suppression of the West Papuan people by the Indonesian occupiers seems to be the norm for successive Australian governments. ",30,TimOfAltona

3125,Sussan Ley is starting to look very impressive in her new role. She presents very well in the media and is clear and concise with her verbal communication.

3129,"The next round of opinion polls are critical to gauge how much longer Abbott can hold on. The nation, including many Labor/Green voters, clearly want Malcolm Turnbull to replace Abbott to steady the ship, throw out unpopular policies that have little or no prospect of getting through the current senate and get on with a more centrist good government. ",60,TimOfAltona
3130,"The challenge for a Turnbull lead government is what to do with the current front bench - some ministers will be feeling a little more secure than others and then there is the issue of the National Party, however I think Turnbull has the smarts to do a deal with the Nats to keep them onside. ",57,TimOfAltona
3131,"I think critically a Turnbull (PM), Julie Bishop (Deputy) and Scott Morrison (Treasurer) along with some changes to other portfolios will see an unbeatable government lineup going into next year's election - particularly when you consider the fairly inept leadership from Shorten and a relatively weak Labor front bench, none of whom apart from Albo, are particularly strong performers in parliament. ",62,TimOfAltona
3132,"I think it's fair to say that a Turnbull, Bishop, Morrison lead government will quickly dissolve any notion that the ALP and their cheer squad have of Labor cruising into government on the back of an unpopular Abbott, with a weak leader and no policies.",45,TimOfAltona
3133,"Gee, I hope Bill has got his numbers right. Labor does not have a great track record when it comes to applying a tax, in fact they have been woeful in the past. This may well have the same outcome.",40,TimOfAltona
3134,"The Labor cheer squad hate the idea that Morrison is actually a very decent person and an effective politician. He certainly showed up how inept Labor were at protecting our borders and with Bill Shorten's policy free zone, Australian voters still have no idea how Labor would protect our borders from people smuggling operations - to be frank I doubt they have any idea either.",65,TimOfAltona

3137,"Labor has not a hope in hell of winning this contest...I think they know this in their hearts and really need to start looking ahead to 2019 when, if Foley is still around, they may be able to cobble together some kind of decent alternative. ",46,TimOfAltona
3138,"That said, if Baird gets 4 years to continue the great work he has already done for the state, Labor may need to wait 8 years before they get another look in - goodness knows how many leaders they will have gone through by then. ",46,TimOfAltona

3150,Nice try comrade - you are fooling no one here.... Labor thinking they can get away not announcing their cost cuts and who they will hit and who will be losing their job until 10pm the night before next year's election will not get them into government. ,48,TimOfAltona
3151,Shorten must be tossing and turning at night with the prospect of having to face off against Malcolm Turnbull across the despatch boxes. He is no match for a Turnbull lead Coalition government.,33,TimOfAltona

3158,"Mark Kenny is spot on - a Turnbull lead government is Shorten and Labor's greatest fear. Turnbull is very likely to reset the government's course and popularity by ditching the more contentious fiscal repair measures, GP co-payment for one, and move the government back towards the centre.

Your fantasy of trying to overthrow a duly elected government midterm is just that, a fantasy. You will just have to wait until 2016 to mark the government's scorecard. If your views are in the minority, which I suspect they are, you will have to wait until 2019 or perhaps 2022 before your Labor/Greens party can regain power. ",125,TimOfAltona

Can't see there is any actual story here that is news worthy? 
I suspect the embarrassing Chris Bowen brain freeze which is headlines in every other media outlet today except The Guardian Australia is worthy of a piece but alas no.
Dreyfus is kicked out because he is a serial offender when it comes to flouting standing orders. Bishop should 'name' him to save us recalcitrant behavior for 24 hrs.  
That said he is not alone. Labor are an undisciplined rabble in QT. Shorten (the destroyer of 'policy developer' Julia Gillard) has no authority and it shows.
Can't see any issue with this - unless Triggs and Dreyfus had something to hide, which is unlikely. 
Normal machinations of government at work.
But John, Labor members did elect their leader - his name is Anthony Albanese. 
The factions took over. told the members to bugger off and installed a bloke called Bill Shorten...a decision they no doubt a truly regret today, particularly with the prospect of a Turnbull lead Coalition government on the horizon.
While Abbott's on a roll he should also lay into the Indonesians over their murderous occupation of West Papua.
Well let's hope the $88k fine goes towards reef conservation.
Because if an economy does not grow, job vacancies stagnate or dry up which is not good for Queenslanders or any Australians for that matter.
Despite my strong reservations about Labor's ability to manage/grow the QLD economy without robbing from future generations, I cannot see any downside from this particular initiative. 
Makes sense to do all we reasonably can to preserve the reef.
Good old Labor fiscal mismanagement. 
They do it every time. 
Gillard's fingerprints,along with Wong, all over it. 
This is why they are in opposition and will remain there for quite a few years ahead. 
Lousy when it comes to managing the nation's finances - all have been always will be.
There is officially no hope left for the Labor cheer squad - their inability to differentiate between a serious piece of political reporting and a tongue in cheek fluff piece like this means they will forever be wallowing in the dark recesses of bitter and twisted retribution for their party's 6 years of dysfunction followed by a sound thrashing at the 2013 election. 
Newsflash - there is a valid reason why the nation rejected the ALP/Greens government in 2013 and nothing Labor or the Greens have done since then demonstrates they have earned the right or have the ability to govern this nation again anytime soon.
Sarah Ferguson is a very good interviewer - cuts to the chase every time. She should be a regular on 7.30.
You may be a bit confused....this report was not commissioned by the Liberal party, it was commissioned by the ABC itself and concluded that Ferguson may have overstepped internal guidelines in her questioning of Hockey.
Good question. 
I'll bet you a $1,000 he didn't answer the question.
I'm with you, the bias by Jones against the LNP during the QLD election campaign was more than I could bear. 
Something should be done about that.
You clearly missed the Leigh Sales interview with Abbott the other night.
...with the Eureka flag fluttering high above Parliament House Canberra.
Fair comment
I'll start forming a queue behind Abbott when you start forming a queue behind Shorten.
Fortunately for us you sit within a minority grouping - according to opinion polls at least. 
Turnbull is by far and away the preferred PM, streets ahead of Shorten and Abbott and has been for a long time now.
Not to mention being twice as popular as Bill Shorten....Oh wait...apart from Abbott anyone is twice as popular as Bill Shorten - even within his own party. 
Albo where are you when your party needs you?
I'm with you, we only want to see presenters on the ABC biased towards the Labor party - after all it is ABC.
You assume that the current policies will remain - think again comrade, there will be changes if Turnbull is named new leader. You still won't like it because it will deny Labor government.
The Labor cheer squad are doing their level best to denigrate the man who they know could deny them government for at least another two terms. 
Their greatest weakness is they have no-one on their side, apart from perhaps Albo, who can match it with Turnbull. 
Shorten is clearly not up to the task of leading Labor to an election victory vs a more centrist Turnbull lead government which explains why most of the cheer squad desperately want Abbott to hang in there so they can try and replicate a Queensland type result where a burnt stick could lead Labor to a win just by being there.
If Andrews wants to spend money wisely he needs to come up with a plan for an airport rail link. 
Globally, Melbourne is about the only large international airport without a rail link to the city. It would remove thousands of cars off the Tullamarine Fwy each day. 
 What's Labors solution? 
I recall the Libs came up with a plan before they were defeated.
Me and about 20 million other Australians.
The East-West link would have been nice.
Newsflash punters!! 
This will only ever see the light of day if Shorten and Labor win the next federal election...in other words it ain't going to happen comrades...Andrews knows this - it's all smoke and mirrors to put pressure on the federal government.
Hang on - I need a cup of coffee before I can answer that.

Fair comment
Please provide the link that shows Wellington is an ALP member or a minister in the new government - I checked his website and could not find it. 
Perhaps you know something even he is unaware of?
Ahhh...Day 1 and allegations of Anna P lying are already surfacing. 
This will not end well for the ALP in Queensland.
Labor crashed and burned over border protection - hell that's exactly why we have the problem today. 
Partly the reason Labor were thrown out in 2013. 
Both Ruddock and Morrison were streets ahead of the succession of failed Labor immigration ministers'.
Perhaps not as strong as they did going after McTernan in his failed attempt to reinvent Julia Gillard (many times over)
It came out in the Schappelle Corby saga that you have a limited time window of around 2-3 days to come up with the cash to buy yourself out of trouble and then after that the system takes over. Smaller indiscretions like traffic offences or minor drug busts are usually handled on the spot or soon after directly with the police involved.
Yes, but in these threads they only want you to focus on and discuss the Liberal politicians - corrupt activity by Labor politicians is a no go area and should never be mentioned.
If it's been around for years, why is it only hitting the headlines today?
We would not have had to endure the years of the Shapelle Corby circus if her family had the readies to get her out within the three day cutoff to buy yourself out of trouble in a Bali lockup.
Those countries are not executing Australians.  
How do you know that the people protesting the current situation in Bali do not also condemn capital punishment in those other countries? You don't.
Why is this allegation only surfacing now? Wouldn't it have been better to raise/investigate this when SBY was still in power - the death sentences may have been commuted. 
Raising the allegation as a valid defence perhaps only days before the execution seems way too late.
Landslide win to Labor?
You go first
Plenty of time to observe and comment on the debacles unfolding in Queensland under an inexperienced and a wholly unprepared for government Labor administration. 
This will not end well for the ALP and its controlling factions.
Ahhhhh...the good old Labor factions kick-in and force Anna P's hand in her portfolio selections. 
Don't Labor ever learn from their past mistakes? 
Day 1 and already we can see the high risk government that has fallen over the line with Greens preferences and relies on 1 independent to stay in power. 
We will be acutely watching this unfold as the errors of judgment are exposed.
So you disagree with his efforts to have these two men's lives saved?
So you disagree with the PM's efforts to have the execution stopped.
Lesson here people - read the label before you buy and avoid cheap food coming out of China. 
Buy Australian (or NZ) grown produce.
What country makes the best blue cheese? 
Any suggestions/brands?
Wrong - my choice for Liberal leader since Howard exited has always been Turnbull.  
Always has been, always will be.
Josh needs to be careful here - no point continually throwing public support behind Abbott when he knows it's a lost cause. Josh has been touted as a future Liberal leader - no point screwing it all up trying to so publicly protect a lame duck PM.  
Won't look too good on his resume.
I think another problem brewing for Abbott is the disappearance of Peta Credlin. Absent from the advisers box all last week, not invited to party room meetings and not seen by his side when he's out and about. 
Something is going on. 
The signs are not good for Abbott's prospects for holding on to the top job.
I think if Turnbull turns the ship around and moves it closer to the centre things will change.
I think you can count on one hand the number who would fall into that category.
He had one major stumble over the Godwin Grech 'Utegate' affair - unlikely we would see a repeat of that error of judgement again.  
I think he is the Libs best chance to move forward - time will tell.
Nice try....everyone knows Labor are scared shitless if Turnbull were to take the leadership - it is Shorten's worst nightmare. 
Turnbull consistently polled as Australia's most popular choice for PM, even through the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd governments. 
Shorten v Turnbull - no contest comrade.
Article relevant to this discussion -
At any examination not a good look for Abbott. 
It was Philip Ruddock who accompanied and mentored Tony Abbott on his 2013 election campaign roadshow.  
Ruddock must now be thinking that Turnbull leadership is needed to take the party forward.
Granted - the LNP have some work to do here.
Exactly...this has all the hallmarks of turning pear shaped very quickly for the ALP  
- extremely inexperienced minority government- relying on 1 Independent to stay in power- tackling fiscal reform without putting the unions and Greens offside- Coal mines, Great Barrier Reef and railways- leasing of state assets to pay for new infrastructure projects. 
Get ready Queensland - this will not end well.
Roll on NSW election - Labor is about to be put back in it's box where it belongs.
So..the burnt stick won.
You ain't seen nothing yet pal - wait until Labor start slashing public service jobs to try and achieve exactly the LNP were going about doing - fiscal reform to get the state's finances back on track. 
If you think Labor will not touch Public Service jobs you are delusional.
No - I don't want to see any children in detention. We got to that point under the Howard government and then the Rudd government came along and opened up the floodgates...next thing we knew thousands of children were being brought in on people smuggler boats by parents hoping it was their ticket to immediate settlement in Australia. 
The number of children in detention are decreasing week by week - there were over 2000 in detention when Gillard was in power.
She is nonetheless an activist. 
Let me guess who put her into that role - ahha! a Gillard Captains pick.
Funny watching the left swarming to put up a protective fence around an activist who is one of their own.
Highly unlikely he will be there to be voted out.
This woman was not voted in........as hard as it is for Labor/Greens cheer squad to admit or even comprehend it was Campbell Newman government being voted out. 
Let's face it, a burnt stick could have lead the ALP and the result would have been the same. 
This will be problematic minority government, relying on 1 independent to stay in power. 
This will not end well for Labor.
This will not end well.
So you agree - it is always a Labor/Greens government.
The majority of QLD'ers voted LNP - look at the primary vote - LNP streets ahead. 
The Greens got Labor over the line with a minority government. 
Does not bode well.
HaHa - the LNP picked up the largest primary vote - the majority of voters wanted the LNP - presumably you are thanking them for their (wise) choice.  
It's only the usual Greens preferences that allowed the ALP to form a minority government. 
This will not end well for QLD.
Now that's she has fallen into Government, she will have to actually come up with a plan that includes coal mines , Great Barrier Reef and cutting costs (jobs) out of government departments. 
This will not end well.  
In fact I go so far as to say it will all end in tears.
Good luck with that.
Now let's watch as Labor screw everything up in QLD. 
History will repeat itself after the disaster of the Bligh years in which this woman played a major role. 
Something tells me minority government will not be Labor's friend in coming months.
Anna P will forever be known as the Accidental Premier.
Be nervous Queensland, be very very nervous.
No we're not. 
The students were not demonstrating peacefully, they were trying to force their way past police into a building they had been refused permission to enter.
They were clearly there to disrupt the meeting. 
Good on the police for keeping the activist rabble out.
Left-wing student activist/demonstrators like this need to learn not to try and break through police lines when they have been refused entry. Fairly simple really.
No pepper spray around back then. Different story today comrade.
Please show the links or photos that show Christopher Pyne macing students? 
Hmmmmm.......
Please let us know who you think would fail on the Labor side?

3244,"Given both Turnbull and Bishop have a higher approval rating for Prime Minister than Bill Shorten, you can understand why Shorten and the Labor cheer squad are starting to panic at the prospect of a leadership change.",37,TimOfAltona
3245,You guys should watch more of Sky News..Richo and Alan Jones team up each week to interview pollies..Morrison was their 'victim' tonight. Morrison actually handled himself pretty well under the intense questioning from Richo and Jones and he would certainly be up there as one of the government's better performers IMHO.,51,TimOfAltona
3246,Funny thing about all this is that Shorten is probably further to the right than Malcolm Turnbull - here's a red hot suggestion... how about we do a swap..Shorten to lead the Libs and Turnbull takes over leadership of the ALP. ,42,TimOfAltona
3247,Laugh it up all you like people....remember you have the same thing coming your way when the Labor left decide Shorten is not up to the job and move against him to install Albo....or will Shorten be reaching around and stab himself in the back this time for the good of the party?,53,TimOfAltona
3248,"I don't understand this at all - a quick scan of comments reveals most of the regular cabal of Labor/Greens cheer squad contributors don't like Tony Abbott, don't want him as our PM and wish he was never elected. ",40,TimOfAltona
3249,"I reckon there are more on the conservative side who want a change of leader but Tony it seems can rely on the Labor/Greens cheer squad, who hate him, to watch his back for him and keep him in office. Looks like Shorten is singing Abbott's praises and urging the Libs to keep him on as well.  ",59,TimOfAltona
3250,Perhaps they think they are being 'clever'or 'funny' - I just see it as a form of grubby low-life cyber bullying carried out by cowards hiding behind a veil of anonymity.,31,TimOfAltona
3251,"Personally, I don't think he can survive because, as with Gillard, the media smell blood and everything he says or does from here on in will be viewed through the prism of his leadership. ",35,TimOfAltona

3255,You can't have it both ways.....either you want Abbott to go or you want Abbott to stay...a car crash at today's Press Club address will ensure Abbott goes..but all I'm reading in these threads is the Labor cheer squad want Abbott to stay on as PM. ,47,TimOfAltona
3256,"Firstly, please show us the links that suggest that NSW will change to a Labor government next month...anything will do...even your own side know that is not going to happen...so best stick to reality. ",35,TimOfAltona
3257,"Again,please show us the links that suggest Murdoch is a communuist....the closest I know of this is he threw his support behind the election of Gough Whitlam who was choc full of socialist idealism...but can't for the life of me find Murdoch's communist background...please enlighten us.",46,TimOfAltona
3258,I'm with you...voters should have stuck with the train wreck that was the Labor/Greens government and Julia Gillard is our rightful PM and would have gone on to do wonderful things for our country. ,35,TimOfAltona

3261,The Labor cheer squad need to take a reality pill here...if the ALP win this election it is has nothing to do with anything the ALP have said or done to earn it....reality is they just had to be there (bit like Shorten at a federal level)...it's not like they have an excellent track record in managing QLD's finances or anything...in fact just the opposite. ,66,TimOfAltona
3262,Every word he utters will be poured over and dissected and one wrong utterance could prove fatal to his chances of regaining the leadership and therefore the Libs best chance of holding onto government for another term or two. ,40,TimOfAltona

3265,It's in the QLD constitution - the incumbent premier remains 'caretaker' premier even if he/she has lost their seat until the results of the election are finalised. I guess if it drags on too long the GG can step in and perhaps appoint an elected member from the party last holding government as caretaker.,54,TimOfAltona
3266,"- Pointing the finger of blame at others - especially Labor - Platitudes like 'building a stronger economy' or 'making the tough decisions' or 'Captain's Pick gone wrong' or 'Strong Leadership' or 'taking the country with him on this journey'- Talking about Labor full stop- Mentioning the Prince Philip debacle - he knows this was a monumental stuff up and so do we- Mentioning 'Carbon Tax', 'Stopping the Boats' and 'Mining tax' as achievements - we know all this and tomorrow is definitely not the time to rehash all that. ",91,TimOfAltona
3267,"-honestly and openly define his leadership and his government's plans for reform- honestly admit that he has made some mistakes (nothing to be ashamed of there - leaders are only human after all and we all do it)- Engage more with backbenchers (they are at the coal face of public opinion and are generally the first to hear when voters are disgruntled). There needs to be a mechanism for this voter feedback, via backbenchers, to not only reach the PM's office but crash through the gatekeepers (Credlin and her team) and reach the PM. Abbott needs to touch on this tomorrow.- Needs to acknowledge the government has not adequately dealt with the issue of global warming and more needs to done in line with increasing international opinion - Needs to take policies off the table that, according to public opinion, will catapult his government into opposition in 2016. He will need to find savings in areas that attract more public support and pass the fairness test. It can be done and communication is everything. ",175,TimOfAltona
3268,I guess under the circumstances he has no choice but to trot that old bullshit line out - but reality is no-ones buying it - all of Australia knows why there was 'very little involvement' from their federal counterparts in the election campaign as much as all Australia knows federal issues played a major part in the outcome - it makes Andrews look totally disingenuous which is the last thing the government needs right now. ,76,TimOfAltona

3271,It seems Labor's internal polling suggests a change to Turnbull and perhaps Bishop as Deputy will turn things around for the government along with some policy revisions closer to the centre. ,32,TimOfAltona
3272,It will also put pressure on Labor to actually come up with a costed policy or two well before the 2016 election - something they are avoiding like the plague. ,31,TimOfAltona

3277,"Here's a tip - it may make you feel better hurling cheap and grubby personal insults to compensate for your understandable fear that Labor have little prospect in winning a federal election for some years yet, but these insults do little more than reflect the author's insecurity. ",48,TimOfAltona
3278,For a whole lot of reasons in my view Turnbull would make the better PM although he does carry a bit of baggage from when he was opposition leader but I think he learned a very big lesson out of that utegate debacle and we would be unlikely to see another judgment lapse along those lines. He also has the Kevin Andrews hurdle to overcome. ,66,TimOfAltona
3279,"Abbott had better do a cracking job at the Press Club on Monday, the task made harder by the inevitable large loss of LNP seats in today's QLD election, but Monday's speech will define the PM's political future. He may survive the next 6 months, he may not.",48,TimOfAltona

3281,"The ALP leader will no doubt be dropped from the leadership as is the Labor Way after elections are lost, but in this case it will be necessary if Labor are to remount a credible challenge in 3 years time.",40,TimOfAltona
3282,Newman was right when he held up 4 pages containing Labor's cobbled together costings which they expect voters to accept as proof of their ability to manage the state's finances' ,31,TimOfAltona
3283,Not particularly...Newman was ok and consistent with his performance in the last debate but I think to Anna's credit she lifted her game a peg or two to stay in touch with Newman.,33,TimOfAltona
3284,I think the Labor/Greens cheer squad should come clean when giving their 'unbiased' opinion that the ALP opposition leader won the debate - Campbell Newman could have been debating a flower pot and the cheer squad would still announce the flower pot the winner. ,45,TimOfAltona
3285,We all wait in anticipation to see what this Anna woman will stuff up during the debate. She was clearly nervous at the last one and mucked up her opening set piece....I wonder how long it will be before a journo asks her to nominate the current rate of GST? ,51,TimOfAltona
3286,Bottom line is the ALP had no intention that this woman would one day be premier. She was a seat warmer to tide the QLD ALP over until they were in a position to contest the election again after 2 or 3 terms in opposition with another leader. ,49,TimOfAltona

3292,The Labor cheer squad need to be cautious here - after months of hysterical screaming to replace Abbott they may get their wish and he could well he replaced by a leader who enjoys significant support/popularity across Liberal/Labor/Greens voters- in fact many believe Malcolm Turnbull is closer to the centre and therefore governing for all than any other likely candidate. ,61,TimOfAltona
3293,Irrespective of the outcome you have to admire Campbell Newman - he could have parachuted into any safe seat held by his party (the way Labor do these things) yet he chose a marginal seat which was always going to be risky down the track. ,46,TimOfAltona
3294,"This Kate woman was rejected big time by the Ashgrove voters 3 years ago - in fact she didn't even campaign under the Labor banner back then, hoping voters would not recognise her as a member of the toxic Bligh Labor brand and this time her tactic is trying to play the underdog to pick up a sympathy vote - at least she is brave enough to associate herself with the Labor Party this time around.

3361,Abbott is right when he suggests that changing leaders can result in the opposite effect of what you are trying to achieve - look no further than the ALP as proof of that. ,34,TimOfAltona
3362,Failing that the decision needs to be made and a transition made quickly to another leader for the sake of the party and the country. The last thing we need is another knife fest with blood splattered walls (the Labor way). ,42,TimOfAltona
3363,I give Tony Abbott until the middle of this year to get some traction and get the polls going the other way or else the tough decision needs to be made for the sake of the country.,37,TimOfAltona
3364,Careful what you wish for - if Abbott goes it opens up the possibility of a more popular Coalition leader emerging and turning around the fortunes of the current government to the point that Labor will continue to languish on the opposition benches for years to come whilst they sort out their future direction and leadership problems. ,58,TimOfAltona
3365,"At some point, &amp; not the night before the 2016 election, Shorten &amp; Labor will need to clearly articulate how they plan on managing Australia's economy, what cuts they will be making and where, how they will manage border protection and anti-terrorism and how they plan to pay for all their policy promises that got them into so much strife during the failed Gillard/Rudd years. ",66,TimOfAltona
3366,"Is it just me, or if a person or persons are disclosing, without authorisation under the Crimes Act, commonwealth information then there is a fair chance they can expect to be investigated to at least determine if a breach has occurred? ",42,TimOfAltona
3367,"As you ask, if I were Abbott I would stay right away from QLD...the LNP can easily win it without support from the PM. Perhaps he will go up there for the 2018 QLD state election - who knows?",39,TimOfAltona
3368,"Ahh..Lee Rhiannon, the former doyen of the Socialist Party of Australia who is on record for expressing her sorrow that the Berlin Wall came down and the demise of the Soviet backed German Democratic Republic and her displeasure on the reunification of the two German states....yes she is definitely one we should be paying attention to and following her lead. ",61,TimOfAltona
3369,"I see the desperation and disappointment is starting to set in as many Labor/Greens supporters start to realise they are backing the losing team.....something most of Queensland and the rest of Australia could have told them, and probably did, weeks ago. ",42,TimOfAltona
3370,"Queensland voters are not goldfish - they actually remember the disaster of the Bligh government only 3 short years ago. Labor are in no fit state to govern Queensland, have not been for the last three years and won't be for another few years away yet...just the way it is. Like federal Labor, they need to regroup, find a strong charismatic leader people will follow and start finding direction and purpose to turn themselves into a viable alternative government in another 3 or 6 years time.

3373,I seriously doubt this woman will be leading the QLD ALP into the next election - she will have given it her best shot in two weeks but with no real expectation that she will win. After this election QLD Labor will need to re-group under a new leader to try and get their shit together for 2018. ,59,TimOfAltona
3374,On the plus side for Labor is that they will definitely pick up a bag of seats in a couple of weeks which is not a bad outcome for them or the state....no disrespect to Ms Palaszczuk but if Labor are to go to the next level she is not the person to take them there. ,57,TimOfAltona
3375,Just look at the horrid things they are doing - fancy protecting the dugongs and sea turtles..how dare the LNP government interfere with those nice poacher folk earning a dishonest living up north? ,34,TimOfAltona
3376,And as for protecting endangered African animals from those nice poor poachers trying to make a dishonest living supplying Asia's insatiable appetite for ivory and other parts of elephants and rhinos - this government should be ashamed of themselves..... ,40,TimOfAltona
3377,...and as for those poor feral cats killing off millions of native mammals every week in Australia - how dare Greg Hunt be so callous as to fund a feral cat extermination program aimed at saving our vulnerable wildlife..... ,40,TimOfAltona
3378,Labor? Well the new Victorian Labor government have just announced that they will allow duck hunting to continue in that state which threatens to decimate already depleted duck species in their wetland habitat - now that's the sort of government we want!,42,TimOfAltona
3379,Best you stop attacking Abbott for trying to have these executions stopped - if he does or says nothing and these men are executed you will be attacking him for doing nothing to save their lives...so he intervenes and he is attacked for speaking out against it. ,48,TimOfAltona
3380,The PNG authorities have a duty of care to prevent detainees harming themselves or others hence the action taken to shut down the ring leaders who wish harm on their fellow detainees by encouraging hunger strikes and self harm. ,40,TimOfAltona
3381,I suspect the people making comments in this thread would vote for a burnt stick if it was the leader of the ALP and right now that's about all they have got. ,33,TimOfAltona
3382,Ultimately at elections voters judge an incumbent government on it's performance and decide if they deserve another term - this why we saw the ALP all but wiped out in QLD last election and again federally in Sept 2013. ,40,TimOfAltona
3383,"In two weeks time, QLD voters will mark the LNP's scorecard and also that of the ALP and decide who they believe, based on the evidence they have, is the best party to take QLD forward for the next 3 years. ",42,TimOfAltona
3384,"No amount of childish name calling, grubby and insulting comments from the Labor/Greens peanut gallery will get Labor over the line...it is up to Labor to demonstrate they have the capacity to govern Queensland so soon after they were emphatically given the thumbs down by Queensland voters. ",48,TimOfAltona
3385,"Polling shows it could be close, talk of a minority govt is in the air, it will certainly be interesting to see the outcome...betting agencies however are picking an almost certain LNP victory. ",34,TimOfAltona
3386,Most Queenslanders will see Newman as a safe pair of hands - it needs two or three terms to reap the benefits of economic reform - the question is..are Queenslanders prepared to re-elect the LNP and give QLD Labor a few more years to rebuild and try and mount a credible claim to govt? ,55,TimOfAltona
3387,Tony Abbott and Rupert Murdoch are not standing for election in the QLD election - I checked the Queensland electoral website and could find no sign of them listed. ,30,TimOfAltona
3388,So you acknowledge this is no more than a shabby attempt by the Wilderness Society to pursue their anti-coal agenda conveniently disguised as something else - certainly sucked in a lot of the anti-Newman supporters going by the comments below.,40,TimOfAltona
3389,The Wilderness Society falls into exactly the same bucket as the Australia Institute - the Greens have their fingerprints all over it and has a significant anti-coal mining agenda. Bob Brown was a past director.  ,37,TimOfAltona
3390,Perhaps this fellow should reveal he is speaking on behalf of the anti-coal lobby group who are intent non stopping the Adani deal by removing the Newman government and shutting down thousands of jobs in the state. Does he say that anywhere? ,43,TimOfAltona
3391,"The BMW's were ordered while Julia Gillard was PM, in fact they were ordered by Nicola Roxon on the advice from the AFP who deemed them more suitable for protection work than the locally built Holden's. They were already well and truly in the pipeline and happened to be ready for delivery just after the Coalition decimated Labor at the polls. ",62,TimOfAltona
3392,"But will Kate fess up to being part of Labor this election, or will she try and hide that fact like she did last time around when she was defeated with a swing of 13% against her? ",38,TimOfAltona
3393,Those drownings are occurring in the waters between North Africa and southern Europe. Tragically they would have been much larger had this government not succesfully shut down the maritime people smugglers in this part of the world.,37,TimOfAltona
3394,Are you referring to the Labor government who started up the boat arrivals and when the numbers got out of control opened up Manus and Nauru to ship the refugees off shore and which the current government inherited and has to sort out the mess? ,46,TimOfAltona
3395,"To be fair to Peter, he has only been in the role for 5 minutes. Perhaps if you go back to the conga line of Labor immigration ministers presiding over Manus it may give you a clue as to how all this started.",43,TimOfAltona
3396,"Don't disagree that these off shore places should be emptied and closed down - but don't forget the same stuff was going on inside on-shore detention centres as well - remember the riots, fires, hunger strikes, sewing of lips etc in Australian detention centres during the Labor and probably Liberal years before that? ",54,TimOfAltona
3397,"Let's face it - the only solution these refugees want is to be allowed to come to Australia by boat, be allowed to roam free on arrival, be provided with accommodation, find a job or go on welfare and live in the community. ",44,TimOfAltona
3398,"That's fine if it is only a few hundred people, but reality is there are millions of displaced people looking for a 'host' country which is why we need a controlled &amp; regulated refugee intake program that ensures a safe and secure assimilation into the community.",46,TimOfAltona
3399,No I mean from authorities onsite at Manus - not people sitting on their keyboards back in Australia pulling stuff out of the air about a situation they know nothing about to suit their political preferences.,36,TimOfAltona
3400,The left don't like 'Stop the Boats' because it was a key plank in the Coalition' drubbing of the ALP last election and one which the government subsequently delivered on and something where Labor spectacularly failed - shutting down the evil people smugglers' deadly trade. ,46,TimOfAltona
3401,"You cannot easily estimate the numbers of lives subsequently saved by this action, but if the Labor years and events between North Africa and Southern Europe are any guide, the numbers would be substantial. ",35,TimOfAltona
3402,Let no one forget that it was Julia Gillard and the Labor government who re-opened these offshore detention centres in 2012 after the Howard government had closed them down in 2004. ,32,TimOfAltona
3403,"This current government is tasked with cleaning up Labor's mess in this area and hopefully, as in the Howard government years, these off-shore facilities will be emptied and closed down - permanently. ",33,TimOfAltona
3404,"PS - I have yet to hear Labor's policy on all this - as far as you can tell they will be maintaining the same rigid deterrent 'Stop the Boats' policy aimed at shutting down people smugglers - will 'Chippendale' be equally critical if it is a Labor government stopping the boats, or is the criticism only reserved for when Liberal governments stop the boats?.",65,TimOfAltona
3405,"That aside, if the detainees are behaving in a way that is unlawful or are a danger to themselves or others some level of intervention is required by the PNG authorities. The intervention however should be commensurate with the threat or risk.",42,TimOfAltona
3406,"The future in health care is research, the flow on from better funded medical research is improved healthcare, better quality of life for an ageing population, fewer visits to the doctor and shorter queues for treatment. The whole nation benefits. ",41,TimOfAltona
3407,"They have, it was called a federal election where, due to past performance, the voters determined that Labor were unfit to govern and were thrown out with a massive loss of seats in the lower house.  ",38,TimOfAltona
3408,The same fate can easily await the current government at the next election if voters deem their performance inadequate and they see Labor have got their shit together and are ready to be in government after one term - I think the latter will ensure the current government will remain comfortably on the treasury benches.,55,TimOfAltona
3409,"Herein lies the problem - in Labor supporter land, all the government has to do is go out and pick the money off the magical money tree (mostly foreign debt) and hey presto all is fine and we all live happily ever after. ",44,TimOfAltona
3410,"In the real world however, it is a little more complex. The government has to find money from other areas to keep pace with the rising subsidies required to fund Medicare and this against a backdrop of falling revenues. Sussan Ley is tasked with trying to find a way to make Medicare more self sufficient and sustainable for the long term without the need for increased overseas borrowings.  ",70,TimOfAltona
3411,If you don't see that $1bn per year saved by reducing inefficiencies in public hospitals or $0.5bn savings in 'workforce reform' in public hospitals is not code for slashing and burning jobs to help pay for Medicare then you would be naive in the extreme. ,46,TimOfAltona
3412,Abolishing the Private Health Insurance rebate to save $6bn is counterproductive as it would channel tens of thousands of patients into the public health system which would be crippled under the strain. ,33,TimOfAltona
3413,Sussan Ley is on the right track to consult with all stakeholders and try and reach agreement on the fairest way forward to make this work...we would then expect Labor and the senate to back the government for the benefit of all Australians.,43,TimOfAltona
3414,Please provide us the links that show where every Liberal government since Fraser have intended to kill off Medicare...while you are showing us that I will provide the links that show every Liberal government Health Minister since Fraser have worked hard &amp; implemented policies to maintain/sustain Medicare. Sussan Ley is no different.,52,TimOfAltona
3415,Problem with your summation is that if Ley were to adopt some of Lenore's 'incisive laser beam'suggestions you will need to get on here and praise the Minister for adopting a well thought out solution that will ensure the viability of Medicare.  ,44,TimOfAltona
3416,...and Labor's solution to fix this is.... you guessed it.....do nothing...except perhaps keep borrowing more money from overseas to keep artificially propping Medicare up because it is unable to sustain itself through the Medicare levy. ,36,TimOfAltona
3417,Now that's smart thinking on behalf of Labor and partly the reason they find themselves sitting on the opposition benches federally and in most states and territories. Sustainable economic management is not one of their strong points. ,38,TimOfAltona
3418,Well done Sussan Ley for going down the consultation path to resolve the impasse and we wish her well in achieving an outcome that is fair but also ensures the sustainability of the Medicare system.,35,TimOfAltona
3419,You cannot allow a piece like this attacking someone else's credentials/credibility go through to the keeper without reminding readers that the author was recently caught red handed by the National Audit Office diverting recommended project funding from the $227m Regional Development Australia fund when she was Regional Services Minister from Coalition held seats into marginal Labor seats. Projects missing out on funding as a result included a cancer centre and an outreach disadvantaged youth facility. ,76,TimOfAltona
3420,"That's the biggest joke of the day. Their anti-coal lobbying and connection with the Greens and Labor is legendary. You only have to look at their Chair, Chief Executive and board members to see this 'thinktank' has Christine Milne and Bob Brown's fingerprints all over it.",46,TimOfAltona
3421,"Ahhh..The Australia Institute - that doyen of the Labor/Greens climate change squad and partly bank rolled by the environmental activist group Poola Foundation (also major benefactor to the Australian Conservation Foundation) who interestingly, also teamed up with GetUp! and the Gillard Labor administration to deliver us the now defunct Carbon Tax  ",53,TimOfAltona
3422,Perhaps the Guardian should have come clean on The Australia Institute and it's anti-coal mining agenda - just for some much needed balance to the article which of course much of the Labor/Greens cheer squad have blindly deemed as gospel because The Australia Institute said so.,46,TimOfAltona
3423,At some stage you must surely realise that the LNP will be returned in QLD.....some will concede defeat earlier than others.....no offence intended but I reckon you will still be claiming victory for Labor they have been defeated.,38,TimOfAltona
3424,"All the anger in this thread directed at the current government over the approval of the Adani coal venture on the basis that it is bad for the environment and counter-productive for the state's economy, yet from what I can see the party they so desperately want to replace the current government,Labor, have also given the green light for Adani to extract coal if the ALP were to win government - yet strangely, critics of the Newman govt are dead silent on this. ",84,TimOfAltona
3425,"Is it a case of only when the LNP are in government, extracting coal is an evil industry destroying Queensland along with the planet, but if it occurs under a  government all is forgiven and maybe it is not such a bad thing for Queensland jobs growth and future prosperity after all? ",54,TimOfAltona
3426,Probably would have been higher if she had not pretended not to be part of the ALP during the campaign ie removing all links to the ALP in her campaign material.,31,TimOfAltona
3427,"Hang on - if this Kate Jones is sooo good at what she does, according to the Labor cheer squad anyway, why was she turfed out by Ashgrove voters in 2012 with massive 13% SWING AGAINST HER.  ",39,TimOfAltona
3428,"Also, why was she so ashamed of the ALP that when she campaigned in 2012 she refused to identify herself as being an ALP candidate - she had all references to the ALP removed from her campaign material - WTF? ",41,TimOfAltona
3429,Ashgrove should be very wary of 'Crafty' Kate - I wonder if she can bring herself to admit being part of the ALP this election or will she try and sneak in using smoke and mirrors once more? ,39,TimOfAltona
3430,Plucking a figure like $100m out of the air is easy to do - problem for Labor is there is no detail to back up how this will be funded (ie what cuts will it have to implement to pay for this) or how it will be implemented and function. ,51,TimOfAltona
3431,I guess election promises such as these are easy to make when you know you have little chance of being elected and will never have to follow through with them.,30,TimOfAltona
3432,So far we have learned they are very adept at making claims by plucking figures out of the air with absolutely nothing to back up the numbers. Apparently however all will be revealed on Friday - maybe. ,38,TimOfAltona
3433,I'm sure Lenore will share with us her incisive investigative journalist skills as she tears open Labor's economic blueprint and delivers an in depth analysis on the virtues or otherwise of the alternative government's economic credentials. ,37,TimOfAltona
3434,Trying to re-write history makes you a laughing stock. Living in denial about the most sordid chapter in the history of the modern Labor party does you or your argument no favours.,32,TimOfAltona
3435,It  scripted - by her UK Labor minder John McTernan. He was imported as her chief spin doctor by a Labor Party desperate to try and reverse Gillard's abysmal polling and he had previously tried to use the same misogyny tactic against UK PM David Cameron (failed there too). ,51,TimOfAltona
3436,Nothing could save Gillard however and she was eventually terminated by her own party (c'mon down Bill Shorten) before Australian voters could have their turn at throwing her and her Labor party out of office.  ,37,TimOfAltona
3437,"At any examination, the Gillard experiment was a disaster for Labor and one from which they have yet to recover from. It is a crying shame that Australia's first female PM was not chosen by the voters of Australia but was installed by some grubby backroom faceless men whilst knifing the duly elected PM Rudd fairly and squarely between the shoulder blades.",62,TimOfAltona
3438,Labor have no chance of winning government in QLD with that person as leader - it's all very well going on about the LNP but if you don't have a leader that's up to the task then forget getting back into government,42,TimOfAltona
3439,Strange indeed how the Labor cheer squad have the belief that abusive comments directed at Newman in Guardian threads will somehow equate to a Labor landslide win in 3 weeks. ,31,TimOfAltona
3440,Labor have NO CHANCE of winning government in QLD with her as leader...NO CHANCE at all. She was an absolute shocker.....trying to tell people that Labor has changed from the failures of the Bligh years is falling on deaf ears...QLD Labor has done nothing in 3 years to demonstrate they have even remotely rebuilt their shattered party and the worst thing of all is she is dancing around the questions about costed policies - won't answer the question. ,79,TimOfAltona
3441,If I were Labor I would be focusing on the 2018 election and how they may be able at least place themselves in a position to be a viable alternative government in 3 years. This year is well and truly all over for them.,44,TimOfAltona
3442,Labor stuffed up the NBN rollout and then Albo tried to hide the massive cost blowouts and delays in the lead up to the last federal election - he got caught out of course and disappeared off the radar for a while while the heat died down. ,48,TimOfAltona
3443,Whether Dutton is regarded as a bad Health Minister is neither here nor there - Sussan Ley is a very talented individual with a massive task ahead of her and it was a good pick by Abbott to install her into the health portfolio.,44,TimOfAltona
3444,"I reckon Dutton would have had a much better result if that was the question, certainly higher than Roxon . The worst Health Minister has negative connotations and unfortunately for Dutton he has been caught up in the anti-co payment debate/movement amongst leftie GPs'. ",45,TimOfAltona
3445,Good to see Abbott maintaining a steady ship with our regional neighbours. Sri Lanka plays an important part in the war against people smugglers and their co-operation means the current off-shore processing facilities will be emptied and closed down sooner rather than later. Everyone wins.,45,TimOfAltona
3446,Last I looked Tony Abbott was not running for a seat in the QLD parliament - so why do the Labor/Greens cheer squad so desperately want to see him campaigning in QLD? ,33,TimOfAltona
3447,QLD'rs don't need federal politicians telling them what do do on election day - they can think for themselves and most have already made up their mind hence a swing back to the LNP. ,35,TimOfAltona
3448,"Here's a tip for Shorten - you represent the worst of Labor in-fighting and dysfunction, I doubt QLD Labor will benefit from you grovelling around QLD with nothing more to say other than Tony Abbott, Tony Abbott, Tony Abbott.",39,TimOfAltona
3449,What a ridiculous assertion that is. If that is the best the Labor/Greens can come up with as part of a scare tactic no wonder Labor will stay in opposition - noone is buying it because it ain't true.,39,TimOfAltona
3450,In my vocab unanimous means agreement across all states and territories - unless something happened over the weekend I'm not aware of - Vic and SA are Labor governments who have already backed themselves into a corner over GST.,39,TimOfAltona
3451,You may be confused over this - any GST reform will not happen in the term of this current parliament - it will be in the form of a referendum at a general election and then only with the agreement of the states. ,44,TimOfAltona
3452,Wheeling Shorten in to try and steady an increasingly precarious ALP campaign is not going to help their cause - Shorten represents all that is wrong with Labor and it's inherent dysfunction and failures.,34,TimOfAltona
3453," There was a valid reason Labor were comprehensively crushed in the last election and those reasons are just as valid today as they were at the last election - all that's changed is the Labor deck chairs have been shuffled around a bit, apart from that - zip.",49,TimOfAltona
3454,"Right here is why Labor have no hope in QLD - if Labor and their dwindling band of supporters think they can just fall into government with no policies, a leader no-one has heard of and the raw memory of the last Labor disaster still fresh in peoples' minds then they are at best delusional. ",56,TimOfAltona
3455,Here's a tip for Labor and their supporters - thinking they can win an election simply by making grubby and derogatory remarks about the LNP without any scrutiny of the ALP will not work as a tactic.  ,39,TimOfAltona
3456,I suspect the reality is starting to sink in for Labor and their supporters that they have no chance of falling back into government in QLD for some years yet. ,31,TimOfAltona
3457,Rebuilding after the disasters of the previous failed Labor administrations takes quite some time and gaining the trust of QLD voters is paramount if they are ever to be trusted with occupying the QLD treasury benches again. ,38,TimOfAltona
3458,"Also, a tip for the Labor cheer squad - calling voters thick or dumb because they disagree with you and don't want another dysfunctional Labor government up there is not the way to ingratiate the Labor party with QLD voters IMHO.",41,TimOfAltona
3459,That said - it would a brave ALP who go to the election on a 'leave the coal in the ground' policy. In fact it would almost guarantee they stay put in opposition - which is pretty much where they will end up anyway.,44,TimOfAltona
3460,Good to see the lead up to the election going to plan for the LNP - only a matter of time before the QLD LNP government are returned with a few less seats. ,34,TimOfAltona
3461,"Advice to QLD Labor for the following election - get leader who's name people can spell/pronounce would be a good start and someone they have heard of before would be an even bigger advantage. Also, don't lose your Deputy Leader a couple of weeks out from the election (does not fill the voters with much confidence in the party) and above all, get some bloody costed policies for god's sake - releasing them around mid-night the night before the election just won't cut it...people simply don't trust you after the failures of the Beattie/Bigh years. Rebuilding takes time.",98,TimOfAltona
3462,NZ have applied two increases in GST since starting out at 10% and the centre-right government who increased it have recently been returned with a historical majority vs the NZ Labour party. ,33,TimOfAltona
3463,NZ has not imploded as a result of GST increases - in fact it's economy is in much better shape than Australia's with a strong budget surplus and a strong suite of social service programs.  ,37,TimOfAltona
3464,"Abbott has always indicated any GST increase would be taken to the people via an election - despite the bleating of the Labor/Greens cheer squad who would have us believe we will have this secretly imposed on us overnight by an Abbott government, the people will decide - as they did in NZ.  ",55,TimOfAltona
3465,Will the opposition oppose in the senate? Probably not if it means lifting Australia out of it's current malaise - providing the right safety nets are place for the vulnerable amongst us.,32,TimOfAltona
3466,"The Human Rights Commission is not a court and Triggs is not a judge. She heads a statutory organisation reporting through to parliament via the Attorney General.

3467,"At a guess has something to do with the fact that Triggs has recommended that this convicted wife murderer not only be released into the community but also reward him with a cheque for $350,000 of taxpayers money for his trouble. ",42,TimOfAltona
3468,What a load of crap you write. Last I Iooked Abbott is the PM and people expect the PM to say something when tragedies such as this occur. Abbott condemns it and you have him cloaking himself in other peoples' tragedies. ,42,TimOfAltona
3469,The Labor opposition have been found wanting big time - no idea what's going on and that leader Anna whatever her name looks like she is a deer caught in headlights - all a bit overwhelming for her. ,39,TimOfAltona
3470, No doubt Shorten will be fast tracking it up to QLD to try and steady a very shaky ALP ship completely unprepared to cobble together the semblance of a viable government with help from the Greens.  ,39,TimOfAltona

3474,If the incumbent is good enough they will be returned to power - if not the people will decide and likely throw them out taking into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of the party that may replace them. ,39,TimOfAltona
3475,"This where Labor are exposed in QLD. They are way off earning the trust of Queenslanders after the debacles of the Beattie/Bligh governments. They have a leader no-one knows or even what her name is, plus they have only 7 or so MP's in a 80+ seat parliament.....a herculean task trying to win back government from there. ",58,TimOfAltona

3536,Yet again you allow anti-Abbott rhetoric to cloud your judgement - let's spell it out in plain english so there is no misunderstanding - the PM was erroneously advised regarding the status of the gunmans firearms licence and Abbott acted on that advice as any PM would do - hell even Julia Gillard would have made statements based on adivce she received - hence an inquiry will be held as to how the PM was given seemingly inaccurate facts. ,80,TimOfAltona

3549,The first term of this government was  going to be challenging fixing up Labor's fiscal mess plus a largely hostile senate to boot.

3551,Why is it that any 'article' emanating from a News Ltd source is immediately scoffed at as wholly unreliable and designed to support the current government - yet for some strange reason the Labor/Greens cheer squad are strangely supportive of this particular article coming out of a Rupert Murdoch paper? ,51,TimOfAltona
3552,It's clear that the ALP and Greens are wrecking our economy by blocking key cost saving measures in the senate. Ironic how the Labor/Greens government mismanaged the nation's finances when in government and have gone on to wreck the nations finances while in opposition.

You wish
All I can say is you are in for a  long and lonely decade ahead with a conservative government in power in Australia. 
Perhaps time to bury the hatred and start backing the government as it tackles major crises abroad.
Unfortunately you are correct - it's how they operate.
I love the way the Labor/Greens cheer squad seem anxious for Australia to experience an Ebola outbreak at home - I guess it feeds their desperation to pin something else on this government - an Ebola outbreak no less! 
In the meantime, the government seems to be getting on with the business of protecting Australians from this dreadful disease.
Spot on
Australia is the envy of Western European countries who lost control of their borders and are now paying the consequences. 
Countries are looking to the Australian policies for assistance. 
Good to see
Indonesia need to tackle the rampant corruption that allows the people smuggling operations to flourish within their borders. 
The Australian government has done it's part in stopping the use of Indonesia as a transit country and launching pad for people smugglers - Indonesia need to step up and do their bit now.
This will not turn out well for Obama
Turnbull was between a rock and hard place, no question.
They say a week is long time in politics - well 2 years (before the next election) is a bloody . 
The polls will start reverting back to favouring the government over the next few months - guaranteed. 
We still await another Labor implosion over factions and leadership - can't be too far away now.
Successive Federal and State governments, Labor and Liberal, have flowed billions of dollars into Indigenous programs over the past 30-40 years with some success and many failures. 
I think pretty much everyone agrees that throwing money at this is not the solution - at some stage disadvantaged indigenous communities need to stand up for themselves and take control of their future - over reliance on government handouts is often self defeating and perpetuates the cycle of substance abuse, sexual assault , domestic violence and longterm unemployment.  
There are some rural and remote indigenous communities that have lifted themselves out of that cycle and they should be the role model &amp; inspiration for other less fortunate communities.
Sarah Ferguson was good - she took no nonsense from either party and made pollies from both sides squirm in their seats. 
Good to watch.
This is where it all goes pear shaped for the Left - blame the media for all the inadequacies and failures of the ALP.
Julie Bishop is winning a lot of cudos in the international community - the Left just don't like to see a strong assertive conservative female politician succeeding on the world stage.  
Good on her.
After the Gillard experiment imploded so spectacularly on Labor you would have to say no - but I believe the sex of the PM is irrelevant if she/he are doing a good job for the country. 
It would be good to see another female PM in this country, but one that was voted in by the people and not in inserted by the faceless factional men in the ALP as Gillard was. 
It was always going to end in tears.
Ian, you have to ask yourself - why is it that centre right parties are in government in just about all western democracies - even the the Republicans are looking solid for a landslide win in the next US elections. 
There is a reason old chap. Think it through.
Obama has significantly more problems at home where American voters gave the Democrats a resounding vote of no confidence just recently. 
It's all unravelling for Obama.
Grubby name calling are the hallmarks of a person who has well and truly lost the argument a long time ago - if you are not capable of mounting an argument without resorting to childish/offensive names then it reflects more on you than it does the Foreign Minister. 
I can mount an extremely solid argument as to why a Labor/Greens party are not fit to govern Australia for at least another 10 years and I can easily prosecute my case without resorting to childish names - give it a go.
Bishop is correct in her assertions that Australia are taking appropriate actions when it comes to preserving the reef. 
Good on her for standing up for Australia and letting the world know this country takes protecting the reef very seriously. 
There is no evidence that the current government have contributed to the degregation that occurred under the six years of Labor mismanagement, in the fact the opposite is true. Hunt has implemented additional safeguards to protect the reef. 
Most of these comments reflect the left leaning fear of a strong assertive woman on the conservative side of politics who is cutting through on the world stage IMHO..
I wonder how many people voted for their local LNP candidate because Abbott made a comment about no cuts to the ABC the night before the election - how many Labor MP's lost their seats on the basis that Abbott said there would be no cuts to the ABC? 
Hmmmmmmmm 
It's true, Abbott did say that and now will have to deal with the criticism from the left, however overall anything that makes the ABC a leaner more effective media organisation without unnecessarily draining the public purse is a good thing.
It's clear the Labor cheer squad are missing the point here - the country could not maintain the debt and deficit that 6 years of a Labor/Greens government saddled us with - while Labor would have us believe that spending money we do not have is the right way to run an economy, it eventually ends in tears for everyone. 
No one likes cuts but the country and the ABC will be better for it.
Good luck with that
I'm with you - it is essential that the ABC only reflect the left side of politics when reporting or interviewing politicians - we do not want to see or hear anything positive about the current government at all - after all this is where our tax dollars are going and we only want them spent on the ABC promoting the Labor/Greens agenda. 
LOL
It would be interesting to learn who is pulling her strings and scripting her - this sure as hell ain't coming from her. 
Let's all play 'Spot the puppetmaster' and then all this may make some sense
I hear Labor are on the look out for a new leader - now there's a thought - Lambie would be a perfect fit for a dysfunctional ALP.
Turnbull is in a difficult position and he handled it pretty well under the circumstances.
Overall, it's good to see the government tackling the costly waste that existed/ballooned under Labor. 
If the Budget is ever to get back into the black, all government waste needs to be trimmed. 
The ABC will be better for it.
Actually, I think you'll find Julia Gillard was the nation's first bogan PM
The ALP and their union masters would be ill advised to go blocking a FTA with China - not if they ever want to be occupying the treasury benches in the next 20 years or so.
The election will be interesting - my view is whoever wins should do so with a clear majority so they get clear air to implement the policies they took to the election (&amp; were presumably voted in to deliver).  
Napthine has not done a bad job as Premier - got the state into the black - probably worth giving another run IMHO.
The image is not supposed to be Frankston - read the text underneath. 
It's the Port Phillip Bay foreshore - looks like Beach St Port Melbourne.
Fair and balanced article - should be more of this in The Guardian - it reflects what the majority of Australians are thinking IMHO.
I'm confused....the Labor/Greens cheer squad are taking this poll as gospel and proof that the Labor/Greens party is on track....yet when the Newspoll reflects the government ahead we are told it is all a Murdoch conspiracy to protect the government? 
Anyone else confused?
A spectacular and successful week for Australia on the international stage - good to see positive outcomes emerge for the country from the G20.
Irrespective of what Xi had intended with his democracy comments, Abbott was spot on in reflecting what the rest of the world would like to see occur in China. 
Providing the FTA is finalised, the visit by Xi to Australia has been a huge success for Australian importers, exporters and consumers - a coup for the Abbott government and now it seems India is in the government's sights for a FTA. 
Great work.
The question must be asked....what would Labor do with this if they were in government? 
What is their solution? They have been strangely silent on this of late which is surprising given they are usually quick to comment when they think they can score a political point against the government, manufactured or otherwise. 
I think I just answered my own question.
So Labor will be blocking this then....good to know.
Massive win for the government and as with all things the devil will be in the detail, providing all the boxes are ticked Labor would be ill advised to stand in the way of this unless they want to commit political suicide and consign themselves even deeper in the dustbin of political irrelevancy. 
Have not heard from Christine Milne yet but anticipate her protest party will be critical of the win - Labor should really hop into bed with another partner if they want to move forward.
Only good can come of this for Australia's future economy - Labor must be spewing that they were not able to bring this together when they were in government. Makes the LNP look good and so it should. 
That explains the negative comments in this thread I guess.
Good comment
All these comments laying the blame as per usual on Tony Abbott for Julia Gillards demise - not one of them are man enough to admit that Gillard was taken out, repeat, it was not the LNP that knifed her, it was Shorten and co (you know, the one who thinks he could be Australia's next PM after flicking Gillard).  
Pretending that Gillard was not the most despised PM, both outside and inside her own party, will not alter the fact that she was a disaster for Labor and a veritable disaster for the country. 
End of story.
I see the Labor/Greens media team are starting early today....I think it is fair to say that it matters not what the outcomes of a Tony Abbott hosted G20 were - the usual anti-government scripted rhetoric would appear. 
y it was a Julia Gillard hosted event all the problems of the world would have been resolved and we would have all been on here commenting what a good thing it is to have a Labor/Greens government running the country and not an evil LNP who's primary objective is to ruin the country and destroy the planet upon which we live. 
LOL
Speculation is always a bit of harmless fun - but I wonder how the G20 and accompanying climate change discussion would have gone had Malcolm Turnbull been Australia's PM instead of Abbott?
Someone has got to these boys in Australia and recruited them to go on what could well turn out to be a suicide mission. 
If the recruiter is in Australia, let's hope the AFP can track them down to prevent this happening to other Australian families.
Indigenous Australians should learn from the ALP experience over the past few decades - disunity sounds the death knell for your cause and aspirations. 
Pearson and Mundine have both in their own ways made a significant contribution to advance indigenous reform - they should be applauded.
The Australian Abbott government is all about smaller government and decreasing the size of the bureaucracy....public service numbers almost doubled under Labor whose ideology is everyone gets everything for free and the government (and taxpayers) will hold your hand all the way.
But hang on... haven't the unions in Australia all but finished off our manufacturing industry and sent it all offshore? 
No wonder no one wanted them involved in the G20 - apart from how to destroy jobs by holding a gun to the heads of employers over wages, what else could they contribute?
See below
If Newman's assurances re the reef are correct then let UNESCO pass judgement. 
If the Labor/Greens detractors are correct then UNESCO will support your assertions by placing the reef on the endangered list. 
If UNESCO give the Newman government a tick of approval over reef management then it would be good to see the Labor/Greens detractors admit they have made a mistake and withdraw their accusations.
Putin is seemingly a national hero in his own country - a rare feat amongst political leaders - the Russian Presidency is his for as long as he wants it and that is all theencouragement he needs - stuff what the rest of the world thinks.
Good and valid comment
Have some patience Daisy - the Chinese leader is in Canberra tomorrow to address parliament and sign the bloody agreement already.
...and replace it with what exactly? 
.
Clear endorsement of Abbott's leadership by Putin -clearly Putin respects a strong leader who is prepared to stand by his beliefs and principles. 
Good result for Abbott in chairing the G20.
How could it ever have been Julia Gillard? No one wanted her as PM - her own party and in particular the voters of Australia. 
 Fail.
I suspect it was because Plibersek does not understand anything about countries outside of Australia - she is illiterate when it comes to international affairs. Abbott did the ALP a favour by saving them the embarrassment of a nobody representing their party.
Sounded like a pretty good speech by Abbott. 
What is Bill Shorten doing skulking around in the shadows of the G20? 
Shouldn't he be out on the street with the rest of the Labor/Greens demonstrators?
Good speech overall by Abbott. 
Big moment for him and Australia on the world stage. Australia can only benefit from hosting this meeting.
Good comment
Could some kind person determine which party was in government when tax payers money was used for FIFA bribes and get back to us? 
This'll be good.
Good riddance - other upside fewer Labor votes next election?
The Greens are pretty much just an environmental protest party - zero credibility when it comes to managing the multi-billion dollar Victorian economy. 
Napthine is doing exactly the right thing.
I think we are laughing now just quietly
Ken Lay is a good bloke.
Nobody wants another Labor/Greens government, including on the surface at least, does Kevin Andrews. 
Something tells me though that if push comes to shove, Andrews will hop straight back into bed with the Greens if it means he is next premier. 
As the old adage goes - a vote for the Greens is a vote for Labor.
Strange how all those refugee advocates, not to mention the hundreds of relatives &amp; friends who monitor these boats have also conspired to protect the government over this to make sure no body knows that boats are still departing, capsizing or arriving on Australian shores - oh not to mention all the locals who used to watch these boats being towed in - they are also participating in the government's conspiracy. 
Funny old world.
Funny, we were just saying the same thing about Labor - you know, the party that was in government who opened the flood gates of people smuggling boats that created the mess the Libs are trying to resolve now..
Good comment
If it makes you feel better, you just keep on believing the boats are still arriving in their hundreds each month like they were under Labor.....I think you'll find you are about the only person left in Australia who believes that however.
Just a few of the Russian comrades coming to visit their comrade brothers in the ALP - nothing to see here.
Ever heard of click-bait? 
The Labor/Greens cheer squad flock to it like bees to pollen.
Good move by PNG - with no more refugees coming to Manus because the government have successfully stopped the people smuggling boats, Manus will start to empty out and eventually close. 
This is a good thing and should be supported by the Greens (&amp; their Labor partners).
Nice try but completely misleading. Italy push the problem of North African refugees onto other European countries. The refugees arriving by boat are not intending to stay in Italy, they want to go to countries further north - Italian authorities give them every assistance to transit Italy and move on.
Now here's an idea,instead of Cambodia let's send the asylum seekers who arrived by illegal boat to the Vatican City. Why not send all those in offshore detention to Vatican City and close Manus &amp; Nauru down. 
I'm sure the Pontiff would welcome them with open arms. 
Problem solved.
There is a place for renewable energy but that alone won't be sufficient for our growing needs - the answer is nuclear powered energy - virtually zero carbon footprint, relatively safe and helps keep fossil fuels in the ground. 
Out of necessity , it will happen one day in this country.
Read the comment directly above your comment and it's all there for you. 
This is a stunt by Labor to try &amp; wedge the government - the risk being that it could all backfire for Labor at the polling booths. 
I'm waiting to see what Labor's plan B is when all this goes pear shaped for them but I suspect, in true Labor tradition, there is no plan B, they just crash and burn.
John Grimes, amongst other things, represents businesses that benefit financially from renewable energy proliferation.........Hmmmmmmmmmm

Just saying
Good comment
Well all I know is that thank goodness we have a coalition government in power looking after our national security in these difficult times - heaven knows what may happen if a Labor/Greens government got their sticky dysfunctional mitts on national security. Shudder to think.
- in 2007 it was Rudd
I noticed most of the Labor/Greens supporters went silent the other day on Rupert Murdoch's backing of the ALP and Whitlam in the run up to Whitlam taking government in 1972. 
Some of the clueless ones even accused Murdoch of being behind Whitlam's dismissal.  
The hysteria around Murdoch by the cheer squad is unbelievable.Murdoch generally backs winners - in 1972 it was Whitlam - in 2017 it was Rudd - in 2013 it was Abbott. 
The Murdoch press called Labor out for what they were - a dysfunctional government self-imploding through ongoing civil wars - fact. 
Blaming Murdoch for Labor's woes is fanciful and reeks of denial. 
Hey even Bob Hawke called out Gillard and Rudd for what they were a - architects of their own demise. 
Perhaps if Labor can get their act together, Murdoch may even back the ALP next time.
Good to see we have sooooo many ebola  residing within the Labor/Greens cheer squad. 
Who woulda guessed?
No one else seems to ask that question except you - perhaps you missed the bit where the government is arranging guarantees on evacuation and care if anyone goes over there on behalf of the Australian government and contracts ebola. 
One thing is certain - if the government had sent Australians over there and one or more of them contracts ebola and dies, you will be the first person on here accusing the government of murder. 
Its just the way it is with the cheer squad.
No one is stopping you from going not least the government - there are plenty of flights via London to west Africa departing from all Australian cities tomorrow. 
Off you go - your assistance will be very much appreciated. 
But if you only want to head over there with the Australian government holding your hand then best you wait a little bit so they can assure/guarantee you of a proper medical evacuation and care should you contract ebola.
Still bitter and twisted over last September much?
What do expect the Australian PM to do - say nothing? 
Clearly you would only be happy if it was a  PM commenting - then it would be totally acceptable. 
Funny old thing politics. Life is too short to harbour so much hatred.
Perhaps there is a problem with their product?
The probability of a co-ordinated terrorist attack on Australian soil is very low - what is more likely is an unhinged individual acting alone which seems to be the case in the two recent attacks in Canada. 
Not sure how you guard against a 'lone wolf' attack where the weapon used may be just a motor vehicle or a knife. 
These are not 'terrorist' attacks in my opinion, but the actions of individuals who are mentally ill sociopaths.
Not happy with our democracy comrade?
All things considered, in these dangerous times it's far better we have a Coalition government in power to ensure national security and the safety of our MPs. 
Labor are influenced/dictated too much by the Greens whose solution to any terrorist act is to sprinkle fairy dust over the perpetrators in the hope they go away.
I don't get why the left cheer squad mock and ridicule attempts to halt the ISIS advance - yes the US stuffed up with one of the arms drops - but the rest reached the right target. 
In the meantime hundreds more Kurd men, women and children have been raped and slaughtered at the hands of ISIS. 
Still funny?
Occasionally I watch QT live on the ABCV - today was such a day. 
You can't help but feel Labor are in all sorts of bother. Overall they have a fairly weak and insipid front bench - clearly not up to the task of effective opposition. Their only consistently effective 'performer' is Albo - all the rest including Shorten are pretenders. Bowen comes in a distant second then Jason Clare a distant third - after that..zilch. 
The government have a number of strong and effective communicators in parliament and the void between the two parties has never been greater in my opinion.
I doubt there will be too many world leaders attending the funeral of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi after he's taken out by the coalition forces or Iraqi army.
The Greens are pretty much confirming to us all how irrelevant they are when it comes to national security issues.thinking that a group hug and singing Kumbaya around a camp fire with ISIS will solve everything just does not cut it with mainstream Australia.

The Greens/Whitlam poster confirms exactly what I have been saying for a long time - Labor and the Greens are one and the same - joined at the hip while they try and help each other hobble past the finishing line. 
Fact - Labor have no hope of getting back into government while they rely on the Greens to get them over the line.

How on earth did Jacqui Lambie get a seat at that senate committee table? She is probably the most dysfunctional senator in the whole joint - a loose cannon - almost invariably irrelevant.
You want the budget passed? - speak to your mates down at Trades Hall.
Not since labor went into opposition - children's games and recalcitrant behaviour is now the ALP norm. Sad really

Good comment
Keep going Scott - majority of Australians are backing you
He enjoys the support of the majority of Australian voters for a job well done - have you ever considered your views are those of a minority grouping?
Actually, you will find it is swinging the other way - 200,000 votes the Coalition. 
This is why the Labor/Greens cheer squad hate this success by the governmentit is a pre-election promise delivered.
The ALP are supporting the government on this.
Either we stop the people smuggling trade or we don't. ALP/Greens opted for the latter and the Coalition opted for the former. 
Good move by Morrison.
It depends on who you talk to - some people claim they or their relatives cried with joy when Whitlam was dismissed - some say he was, in the finest of Labor traditions, sending the country broke with his social reform agenda where everyone got everything for free but there was no money to pay for it all - sound familiar?
Good luck with that
Well, as the poster boy for the Labor/Greens cheer squad, David Marr would say that wouldn't he? 
Without foundation, just leftist speculation. 
Speaking of lengths politicians will go in pursuit of power, any chance you can look at the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years David - or is that too close to home?
Whitlam had plenty of flaws and he took government after nearly 25 years of conservative rule (pretty much any mug leading the ALP could have done it - even Bill Shorten would have scraped through). 
The problem the ALP have now is that they are devoid of talent on their front bench - aint no Whitlams or Hawkies in sight. 
Labor will be in the wilderness for at least another two terms and probably 2 or 3 changes of leadership.
As with all Labor governments, more recently Labor/Greens governments, Whitlam ultimately presided over an economic messspend,spend,spend..which eventually lead to his downfall. 
Labor governments have a poor track record with economic management. The Liberals always return to fix up the mess.
Who pick's up the tab for you to go to university for free comrade? 
Try Cuba, I hear they still run with free unis and health care. 
Life is not a free ride anymore.
Whitlam's passing allows us to reflect on how mediocre and irrelevant today's ALP is.  
Labor and the Greens will pay for the disastrous Rudd/Gillard/Rudd (Brown/Milne) period for Australia was and their own party. 
There is a HUGE vacuum in Labor/Greens land right now with noone to fill the void. 
Labor need to work hard to find another Bob Hawke to lead them out of the abyss in my honest opinion.
The labor/Greens cheer squad get all excited when a Newspoll 2 years out from an election show Labor have a slight advantage - evidence they say that a Labor/Greens government will be returned in 2016. 
Here's a tip - Labor and the Greens are in no position to form a government for a very long time ahead. Using polls 2 years out from an election as evidence is naive and reeks of desperation. 
The polls will swing back to the government next year.
Unhinged comments such as this ensure Labor are gone in 2016. 
JS
Many of those listed were caused by the previous Labor government - the government will need to sort it out from here and they will in my estimation.
The Julia Gillard experiment was a total disaster for the ALP - a rump of it's former self. 
I suspect Gough would not have been impressed with the Gillard/Rudd civil war tearing Labor apart.
Settle down - do we detect a hint of more Labor disunity tearing the party apart and keeping it in opposition for years and years to come? 
Disunity is death for Labor. You only have to look at the Rudd/Gillard years to see the damage caused.
The 'Labor values' pursued by Whitlam were closer to those of Fidel Castro at the time. Everything free for everyone. 
We all know how that ultimately worked out.

This must surely be an indication of his effectiveness as our next PM.Labor supporters will of course disagree - but you can't take away from him his innate ability to prosecute his case to the electrorate - why else are Labor in so much disarray and clutching at straws hoping a recycled Rudd will deliver them a miracle? On this alone Abbott should be given the opportunity to govern the country for 3 years or more. If he fails to retain the confidence of the electorate or his party, Malcolm Turnbull is a pretty good Plan B.",155,TimOfAltona
3830,"To the contrary, Rudd will lead Labor to defeat at the election. Interesting thing is that he will still try and stay on as leader of the opposition on the basis that he and only he can deliver victory in 2016. His personality defects and union power brokers will ensure he won't get that opportunity. Shorten will take on PM Abbott (or PM Turnbull) in 2016. Nothing to be afraid of there at all.",74,TimOfAltona

3833,You need to get up to speed with your own party. You are quoting slogans from the failed Gillard administration. Even Rudd is trying to shut down the carbon tax because of the damage it has done to the economy. Notice he is now calling it a 'Tax 'and not a 'Price'  ,54,TimOfAltona
3834,"You could be right - he may hand the baton over to Malcolm Turnbull by then, which will keep Labor out of government for at least another term or two - wow, that's 5 terms with Labor in the political wilderness.Couldn't have happened to nicer bunch of losers.",48,TimOfAltona
3835,Only defeated union hacks are still trying that tired old line. You must be ashamed and disappointed of what the ALP have done to the Labor party of old. As a union official you used to be part of a proud politcal party. That ship has sailed when the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd circus took charge.,53,TimOfAltona
3836,No amount of conspracy theories bandied about by increasingly desperate Labor supporters changes the fact that Rudd and Labor are finished. All that remains is by how much? How much of the furniture has Rudd really saved before he bows out of politics?,43,TimOfAltona

3838,I'm waiting for Rudd to criticise Abbott for not personally attending the Syria briefing tomorrow - it 'happens' to coincide with the Liberal Party campaign launch in Brisbane. It smacks of a Rudd ambush.  ,36,TimOfAltona
3839,"Abbott should have clear air to implement all his policies. If it all turns pear shaped then the Libs will be voted out in 2016, but if it turns out to be very good for the country, the Libs will be in power for 3 terms or more. ",49,TimOfAltona
3840,"I disagree, the country should no longer be held to ransom by a fringe minor party in the Senate. Abbott needs a clear run in both houses to implement the changes required to get the country back on track. The Australian voters will pass judgement on all that in the 2016 election.

3841,I take it your referring to the ALP decision to knife Gillard and insert a recycled Rudd? I gree whole heartedly - it was the dumbest idea of all time. How dumb could they get?,35,TimOfAltona
3842,"I remember the crippling interest rates when he was PM - disaster for home borrowers, plus he, like all Labor govts, spent all the money in the bank and it was up to the Howard govt to get the country's finances back on track - not dissimilar to what is about to occur now.",54,TimOfAltona
3843,AFR has nothing to do News Ltd - Fairfax have no reason to bow to Murdochs wishes - they report as they see it. Labor supporters can't understand this. ,30,TimOfAltona

3845,"Today's recommended reading is the AFR report on the background to Rudd's knifing of Gillard. Makes very interesting reading and raises many questions about Rudd's suitability to lead the ALP.No wonder Rudd ran away when questioned about the report this morning.Oh well, at least he can enjoy his last 13 days as PM.",53,TimOfAltona
3846,"So in these dying days of the Labor govt and the dying days of Rudd's political career you need to ask yourself the question - How did this happen? Could Labor have played any part in it's own demise? Most Labor supporters are in denial that somehow Labor have contributed to their current predicament. They only want to blame everyone else - Tony Abbott, the media, evil mining magnates etc. ",71,TimOfAltona
3847,This is exactly why Labor are about to be thrashed - they need time out in opposition to analyse why brand Labor has failed so spectacularly and how they can rebuild and regroup to have another viable crack at forming govt in another 10 years or so.,47,TimOfAltona

3853,"You have the Labor disease - blame anyone or eveyone except the ALP itself for the predicament Labor is now in.  Your comment perfectly reflects why Labor need a good long stint on the opposition benches to sort themselves out, decide what they stand for, sort out all the factional infighting and prepare themselves for another stint in government in another 10 years or so, provided they can get their act together by then.",75,TimOfAltona
3854,"Not sure what all these Labor people are getting so hot and bothered over one poll in one seat. It's very likely Rudd will retain his seat, which is a shame because Glasson would actually be better for Australia's future than Rudd. That aside, Labor are about to lose the election and will be turfed out whether Rudd holds his seat ot not. Labor supporters, like the ALP, need to now focus their attention to 2016 and start planning how they will fight that election. The big question will be who the new leader will be. The betting agencies have Shorten as odds on favourite to be leading Labor by December.  ",113,TimOfAltona
3855,"Rudd will be turfed out of the leadership almost immediately by the unions after Sept 07, which is good for Glasson because he is almost certain to win the Griffith by election when Rudd bows out of politics to chase his UN dreams.",43,TimOfAltona

3868,The polling and betting markets are aligned. I think the latest is Coalition $1.10 Labor $7.00. This back to where they were when Gillard called the election under her prime ministership.Rudd and Labor are finished.,35,TimOfAltona

And the shonkiness of their rubbery figures? Don't the media care about the concept of credibility any more? Cringeworthy complicity with the ALP is all we get now.

This cycle has been ongoing for the past 50 years. ",68,TimOfAltona

3908,"So, if Abbott had said something before the House of Commons vote you would have condemned him for it, and now he has said something after the House of Commons vote you condemn him. What exactly would you have him do about Syria that you would find acceptable?",48,TimOfAltona
3909,"He won't. Why would Abbott want to be marching to Obama's tune? Obama's Democrats are buddy buddy with Rudd and Labor, Abbott has no interest in following Obama's lead on this and he won't. If anything here, Rudd is more likely to get us involved through his friendship with Obama. Abbott is right when he says we are kidding ourselves if we think we can or will contribute anything militarily to this situation. Our contribution will be through our seat at the security council.",84,TimOfAltona
3910,You guys are delusional. Why would Abbott be beholden to the Obama administration - Obama's Democrats are aligned with the ALP and Rudd. Abbott has no reason or desire to be seen marching to Obama's tune and won't. Settle down children.,41,TimOfAltona

3912,Your comments are getting more and more delusional and irrelevant to the debate. You need to settle down a bit - are you going to try and keep this up for the next 9 years?,35,TimOfAltona
3913,Valid point on Libya - where did all that money go?  Abbott is probably the one who is erring on the side of caution - which is a good thing in this matter and he is correct when he say's we are kidding ourselves if we think Australia can make any meaningful military contribution. Our contribution is in the Security Council alone.,63,TimOfAltona

Strong rumors are he was banking on winning the election to boost his chances of replacing Ban Ki-moon at the UN - lobbying for that role would have immeasurably easier if he was Australian PM. With the prime ministership now beyond him, the UN Role will be harder, if not impossible to obtain.

4049,Your response is totally unconvincing and merely follows the exact line I was pointing to - nowhere do you acknowledge that forces within her own party made a major contribution to her demise. All you want to focus on is media conspiracy theories and how unfairly Tony Abbott as LOTO treated her. ,53,TimOfAltona
4050,"Last time I looked - a LOTO is the alternate PM charged with winning govt for his/her party.

4068,James Rufus - you are unbelievable. Lumeth made his position very clear - I could even understand his position - he is not for the Liberal party - he is for the Labor party yet you continue to shoot him down in flames. ,44,TimOfAltona
4069,On that basis Shorten should happily let Albo get the gig first up and then bide his time until he thinks Labor are electorally viable once more and then take on the leadership (new rules permitting) - most likely in the second term of an Abbott govt.,47,TimOfAltona
4070,"As much as the Labor/Greens cheersquad would have us believe, there is no media black out on boat arrivals - as you say, there are plenty of other sources for that kind of information - the govt is simply saying they will release official figures weekly. ",47,TimOfAltona
4071,"If you tune into the weekly media briefing you will learn about boat arrival activity - as much as you would love there to be, there are no media blackouts on boat arrivals. ",34,TimOfAltona
4072,Bottom line in someone has to take charge and deliver on the coalition's pledge to stop the illegal boats. It will never happen with 16 different govt agencies running around uncoordinated and without central leadership. ,36,TimOfAltona
4073,"Mate, the idea is that people don't get on the boats in the first place. That is the priority - everything the coalition are doing is to disrupt and ultimately destroy the smugglers business model.  ",37,TimOfAltona
4074,"You seem to think that men, women and children paying to board boats that have already been sabotaged to sink at any time, all risk drowning with the survivors spirited out of Christmas Island within 48 hrs to Manus or Nauru never to set foot on Australian soil is a viable product for people smugglers? Hmmmmmm. ",57,TimOfAltona
4075,The coalition are on the right track here and there is no media ban. Tune into the weekly media briefings to learn how a successful government is dealing with this problem.,31,TimOfAltona
4076,"Remember, we do live in a democracy and In 3 years time you will have the opportunity to vote out this government if they have failed to perform. If everything the Labor/Greens cheersquadders are saying in these forums are true then the Abbott government will be well and truly voted out.  ",53,TimOfAltona
4077,"If you want the boats to keep arriving, just say so. If you don't, let the coalition get on with the job of fulfilling their election pledge and one of the key platforms of their election win. ",38,TimOfAltona
4078,There will be weekly briefings where arrival information will be disseminated to the media. Other operational information will be disseminated as seen fit by the operational commander - not dissimilar to any other military led operation. ,37,TimOfAltona
4079,The bottom line is the coalition are going about fulfilling a key election pledge and perhaps it's better we let them get on with it. Nothing in the rules that says they have to use the same failed template Labor used in their disasterous handling of this issue.,48,TimOfAltona
4080,You will have an opportunity in 3 years time to vote them out if they have not performed. Probably a bit premature calling for that when they have only been in govt for less than 1 week don't you think?,40,TimOfAltona
4081,"I had already guessed you are way way to the left of Labor -perhaps there are some other countries that would be a better place for you to live with like minded folk - let's see.... Cuba, Venezula, North Korea perhaps? In the meantime I guess the CPA is providing you with fellowship here.",54,TimOfAltona
4082,You appear to be confused over the election outcome. Labor lost and the Coalition won. Tony Abbott is now PM as a result. If you don't take my word for it hop onto the AEC website and you will see that what I say is the truth. ,48,TimOfAltona
4083,You all seem a bit confused by your Labor/Greens leanings - there will be a weekly media briefing where boat arrivals (if any) data will be officially released by he minister. You won't be getting he daily update Labor provided. ,41,TimOfAltona
4084,If you renew your subscription to The Australian you can find out what News Ltd are reporting on this - they don't appear to have any concerns with the way the govt is handling this so far.,37,TimOfAltona
4085,"That said, you make an assumption that boats will sink and people will drown - clearly you became accustomed to that during the Labor handling of this issue. The coalition are all about preventing any of that happening at all, so let's all hope that is now a thing of the past.",52,TimOfAltona
4086,Gee these Labor/Greens cheersquadders love a good conspiracy theory don't they. I've read a million of them since the Coalition won govt. This a good one above - a member of the navy or customs service is killed while on duty and it's covered up. What a laugh. ,49,TimOfAltona
4087,Turn back the boats when it is safe to do so is only one policy option available and will be assessed by the navy commander on the spot. If he/she deems it as unsafe it won't be undertaken and the boat will be taken to Christmas Island. Turning back the boats has occurred previously and may or may not be applied depending on the circumstance in each case. Give it a chance and it may just work. ,78,TimOfAltona
4088,Good to see you are honest enough to admit your'e only on here to shit stir and make it at as difficult as possible for the coalition to deliver on their election commitment. ,34,TimOfAltona
4089,Looking forward to your comment one day congratulating the coalition on achieving their promise to stop the boats in their first term - despite Labors best attempts to prevent that happening.,31,TimOfAltona
4090,"To suggest that the govt will keep arrivals secret is Labor induced conspiracy nonsense. By my reckoning there are several hundred people on Christmas Island who all have access to mobile phones, email and twitter who can (and probably will) report on any arrival activity. The govt will be confirming arrivals at their weekly briefings.Doubt very much they would deny arrivals if photos and the twittersphere has been alight during the week depicting arrivals. ",75,TimOfAltona
4091,Yep - as I said it's only a matter of time. Clearly there will still be opposition amongst Coalition MPs but providing the 60% of Labor MP's who voted against it last time come across then it should make it to the senate. More likely second term I'm picking.  ,51,TimOfAltona
4092,Stopping the boats was a key election promise and now they have won the election they are getting down to the business of shutting the gate on illegal boat arrivals. ,31,TimOfAltona
4093,"The consequences of this are that the country will be saved billions of dollars of tax payers money, potentially hundreds of lives will be saved from drowning and it permits the thousands of genuine refugees to proceed to Australia in the orderly refugee intake program. ",46,TimOfAltona
4094,"This is of course bad news for the many Labor/Greens cheersquadders on here who are anxious to see the boats keep coming. Nothing would please them more that to see the hundreds of boats arriving since Labor opened the floodgates, to keep arriving.  ",45,TimOfAltona
4095,I say give the Coalition a chance to get on with the job and do their best to fix this problem - perhaps even give them a bit of support - it will benefit us all and prevent the possibility of more drownings. Worthy cause one would think.,48,TimOfAltona
4096,I think you are being somewhat melodramatic. Let's assume that the Coalition know what they are doing and give them a chance to prevent boat arrivals without condemning them before they even get going. ,35,TimOfAltona
4097,"If they do stop the boats, I hoping you will be the first to congratulate them for a job well done and acknowledge that they have handled this significantly better than Labor. ",33,TimOfAltona
4098,After all it was Labor under Rudd that first opened the flood gates and caused the tens of thousands of arrivals and 1000+ people drowning at sea. The Coalition are going to do everything possible to close the gates on the biggest Labor stuff up in a generation.,48,TimOfAltona
4099,You need to give them a chance to stop the boats - if they do so then those places won't be required. Contingency plans are the sign of a competent government. Something that Labor got caught out time and time again over this issue.,44,TimOfAltona
4100," In fact, they derive so much joy from every boat that arrives that they flock to the Guardian comments sections to congratulate each other and themselves for their outstanding contribution to the Labor cause. ""Bring on the boats"" they shriek from the roof tops - ""we told you the Coalition wouldn't stop the boats"" say the cheersquadders who have blamed every boat arrival from roughly 10pm on election night on Tony Abbott. ",74,TimOfAltona
4101,"The cheersquadders worst nightmare and causes them to wake at night in cold sweats is the Coalition actually may stop the boats. The Coalition may actually succeed in preventing men, women and children drowning at sea. ",37,TimOfAltona
4102,"Tom, he has the knowledge and experience in co-ordinating large scale, multi agency operations. I doubt a civil servant would have the required background to pull off such a massive and critical operation across 12 large government agencies (incl navy, airforce and perhaps army) working to protect our northern borders and halting the people smuggling trade.",56,TimOfAltona
4103,"I expect you are still seething from the thrashing Labor received at the polls so let's get real here, there will be nothing, but nothing, Abbott or the Coalition Govt does that you will agree with. You and the rest of the Labor/Greens cheersquad will be slamming everything they say or do. ",53,TimOfAltona
4104,"So while you're mired in bitterness and hatred, the coalition are getting on with the business of govt and quietly sorting out the many failures created by Labor in the past 6 years. ",34,TimOfAltona
4105,If you hop onto the Liberal website - www.liberal.org.au - it details how this will work and you will clearly see how the 12 government agencies are coming together under one operational and ministerial command. ,36,TimOfAltona
4106,"Under Labor all these agencies were uncoordinated which lead to a breakdown of intelligence, response capability and overall effectiveness. The Coalition's plan looks like being fairly effective in combating people smugglers' - time will tell. ",36,TimOfAltona
4107,While you're on the Liberal website you may as well take the opportunity to join up and get your membership underway.This way you can be a part of the success of the Coalition govt over the next 9 years or so by actively participating in the actvities of your local Liberal branch. ,53,TimOfAltona
4108,Not at all - I was critical of the Steve Bracks decision and also critical of the coalition bandying around the word 'mandate' because nothing raises the hackles more than that word and it's too easily shot down. ,39,TimOfAltona
4109,"Politically, he always supported the government of the day and bravely fought against the Nazis and Japanese in the 1940's and then switched his sights to the war on socialism in the 1950's.",33,TimOfAltona
4110,Abbott always said if the tax review or the states pushed for GST revision nothing would happen in the first term - he would take any GST change proposals (if any at all) to the next election and allow the electorate to decide. Funny thing is it is Liberal WA and Labor ACT who are calling for GST revision. ,60,TimOfAltona
4111,Rudd did not make any immediate changes (like Abbott) to public service heads in 2007 - he waited for a few months. Howard got rid of some APS heads as did Keating when he came in.,36,TimOfAltona
4112, Perhaps it may be better for you to focus on the problems down at camp Labor and propose how they will be able to pick themselves up and dust themselves off and try and get back into contention over the next few years. ,45,TimOfAltona
4113,Clearly he did not say that - that's your manufactured interpretation. He did say there would be sweeping changes to the public service which included cutting numbers (several thousand over time) and review structures and personnel. As per my comment above - Abbott needs to work in close partnership with key public service heads and it's his call entirely who he wants in those roles - all incoming change of governments do this.,73,TimOfAltona
4114,The new government need to work in close partnership with senior public servants and they have to make the call on who's in and who's out to achieve that level of confidence. ,33,TimOfAltona
4115,"I love how the Labor cheer squad vilify Abbott for not having enough females in Cabinet yet tear down and vilify Julie Bishop, Michaelia Cash, Sophie Mirabella et al. ",30,TimOfAltona
4116,So the message I hear is on one hand Abbott should be condemned for having not enough Liberal/National females in Cabinet but any females he could choose from are useless and a waste of time and space. Just read some of the comments about senior Liberal women from the Labor camp in these forums.  ,56,TimOfAltona
4117,You gotta be kidding - so you would be happy with Labor coming away from the election with 38 seats (if they were lucky) with Gillard in charge. Would have all but ruled out Labor for a generation or more.  ,42,TimOfAltona
4118,Good comment - the lefties on here will have nowhere to go soon - Abbott will be delivering on his promises and they'll still be thrashing around in their bitter and twisted world of denial and defeat.,37,TimOfAltona
4119,Abbott has come in and is sticking to the basic things he said he will do for the past year and that is his primary focus for the first 100 days. ,32,TimOfAltona
4120,Don't fret Daisy - same sex marriage will be legislated under a Coalition govt - I'm picking they will go into the second term with that affirmation. It's only a matter of time - naturally Labor/Greens will support the passage.,40,TimOfAltona
4121,I'm sure ozbill and his small band of cohorts will do their very best to fill in the gaps for us between scheduled government press conferences - as only they know how.,32,TimOfAltona
4122,"Chippy it was more than just Mike Smith who could'nt stand Gillard - roughly two thirds of the Australian population and over half of her own party lined up to boot her out, including the current acting leader of the Labor Party and both of the current ALP leadership aspirants. She was a massive failure for Labor.  ",59,TimOfAltona
4123,"While you languish and long for a return to the bad old Gillard days, the new government is getting down to the business of government and working hard to mop up the failures of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. ",38,TimOfAltona
4124,"This why Australia voted them in. No amount of bitter and sordid vilification directed towards the government from a handful of losers in this thread who voted for Rudd changes the fact that the Coalition, with a massive majority in the Lower House and likely control of the senate in July, are only 3 weeks into a very long period of government, perhaps 9 years or more. ",68,TimOfAltona
4125,Australia specifically provided/donated Indonesia with superceded RAN patrol boats for anti- people smuggling duties - guess where Indonesia have deployed these vessels? In the north - well away from any people smuggling activity. ,34,TimOfAltona
4126,Complex lingusitic analysis has confirmed that this person Mark Norrie is clearly a sad ideological supporter of the failed communist regime in Cuba and has only just emerged from mourning the death of Venezula's Hugo Chavez. Dude you are so outed......,41,TimOfAltona
4127,He's actually a key guest at the North Melbourne Grand Final breakfast in full view of the media and hundreds of thousands of footy fans around the country - hardly hiding is he?,33,TimOfAltona
4128,Mate your talking crap - Indonesia requested Australian navy assistance because there were no Indonesian search and rescue assets in the area - Australian navy responded. It has nothing to do with any agreements between govts. ,37,TimOfAltona
4129,"Hey I thought you were going along really well - you started with this is not a Labor v Coalition issue, needs to be addressed in a bipartisan manner - all good - and then you launched into your usual anti-Coalition rhetoric. ",43,TimOfAltona
4130,They are trying to prevent the boats departing Indonesian shores. It is widely recognised that Rudd opened up the floodgates when he dismantled the Howard Pacific solution and now this govt is trying to shut the gate again - exactly the same as Labor were doing when they lost govt a couple of weeks ago. ,56,TimOfAltona
4131,"Perhaps it's time the Labor/Greens cheersquad give up on trying to use this for their own vilification agenda and get in and support the Coalition to do what it can to stop the boats and stop the drownings of men, women and as we saw yesterday many many children.",49,TimOfAltona
4132,Australia has a proud tradition of humanely accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees from all corners of the world in the past 100 years and continue to do so today.,30,TimOfAltona
4133,There was no boat turnaround - the boat was 6 nautical miles off the South Java coast when it started sinking. Indonesian search and rescue attended the scene and started recovering bodies from the water. ,36,TimOfAltona
4134,Someone has to tell the Indonesians to pull their head in and start seriously tackling the illegal boats - not leaving Australia to do all the heavy lifting while hundreds drown. ,32,TimOfAltona
4135,"Alexander Downer may be a former Foreign Minister but he is now a private citizen, has been sine July 14 2008 - as much as Labor/Greens supporters want to represent him as a spokesperson for the government, he is entiled to his opinion and he is spot on with his observations.",51,TimOfAltona
4136,You comment is a great example of why 90% of the comments posted by Labor/Greens cheersquad are irrelevant and superfluous to any debate. It's all mindless nonsense posted by bitter and twisted people who saw their beloved Labor/Greens government thrown out of office in spectacular fashion. ,47,TimOfAltona
4137,"Bring on the boats, bring on the drownings, long may the people smugglers operation continue while there is a Coalition govt in office you say. Only Labor can 'stop the boats' you say. ",34,TimOfAltona
4138,The people smuggler kingpins have key people in these agencies on their payroll to allow them to operate with impunity - exactly the same MO as the drug cartels in Mexico. The profits from people smuggling operations run into millions of USD per year. ,45,TimOfAltona
4139,I'm looking forward the Coalition taking on the Indonesians over this and applying some pressure - we have a fair bit of leverage given we throw hundreds of millions of dollars of Australian taxpayers money at the Indonesians each year calling it 'aid'. ,44,TimOfAltona
4140,Time for Matelagawa to pull his head in and start shouldering some of the heavy lifting to stop the boats instead of leaving it all up to Australia to do.,30,TimOfAltona
4141,"It is an assumption - Indonesia asked for help from the Australian navy which entered Indonesian waters to effect the rescue - the big difference being that if we had a Labor government the people on the boat would have been transported all the way back to Christmas Island. Now that we have a competent govt in control, the people were returned to Indonesia. ",65,TimOfAltona
4142,"No, Downer is actually spot on. The Indonesians have been taking us for a ride for a long time. We channel billions of dollars of 'aid' into the Indonesian govt each year and in return they send us illegal boats. ",41,TimOfAltona
4143,"Bowen sounds the alarm on.........""quick I'd better say something about this before the Australian people cotton on to how irrelevant the ALP are now - Kevin come back, Labor needs you""",31,TimOfAltona
4144,As far as I recall Alexander Downer is a private citizen and is entitled to his opinion - you make out like he is still Foreign Minister and your rhetoric is full of exaggerations and mis-representations on a whole range of issuess which is pretty standard for the Labor/Greens cheersquadders on here. ,53,TimOfAltona
4145,Downer is right by the way - the Indonesians need to have respect for our sovereignty - it is Indonesian vessels that are illegally entering Australia's 24 nautical mile maritime zone and we have every right as a sovereign nation to protect our borders - exactly the same as the US Coast Guard do with illegal refugee Cuban boats entering US territorial waters and Italian Coast Guard do with illegal refugee Algerian and Libyan boats coming into Italian waters. It's called border protection - something that is lost on the labor cheer squad. ,94,TimOfAltona
4146,"You seem to be a little angry, you only want to read commentary that is critical of the Govt, anything else is clearly unacceptable and you attack the author - perhaps you may like to move across to Independent Australia - it's full of Left fringe dwellers making comments like yours. ",52,TimOfAltona
4147,I sense your growing frustration. The left need Abbott visible on a daily basis to keep up their vilification. It's ripping the Left apart that they are being denied that daily dose of manufactured bile and hatred they so clearly enjoy participating in. ,44,TimOfAltona
4148,Labor/Greens cheersquad don't like Abbott as a small target - they would much prefer he be in the news day in day out so they can vilify him on anything and everything he says - I suspect they are getting a bit annoyed that he is denying them that pleasure - hence the frustration in many of these comments. ,60,TimOfAltona
4149," These are Indonesian boats, under Indonesian flags, crewed by Indonesians operating unlawfully within our maritime zone - we have every right to repel a breech of our sovereignty. ",30,TimOfAltona
4150,Good to see the Greens power in the Senate removed from next July. No longer should a minor party hold a country to ransom to enforce it's own ideology on the majority of Australians who didn't vote for them. ,40,TimOfAltona
4151,After dipping out badly in both Indonesia and Australia were all the reporting was positive he has found 3 lines from Al Jazeera in the Middle East - Ha ha ha. ,32,TimOfAltona
4152,This is hilarious - before he gets to Indonesia the Labor/Greens cheersquad condemn him for being too hard on Indonesia and threatening our relationship and when he gets to Indonesia and makes a speech the Labor cheersquad claim he's being too soft on Indonesia and should be tougher. ,49,TimOfAltona
4153,Pretty much confirms my assertions that it matters not at all what Abbott says or does - the Labor cheersquadders only want to cut him down as payback for their crushing defeat on Sept 7.,35,TimOfAltona
4154,Which he has. There are plenty of media reports today hailing the visit a success both from a trade and investment perspective and laying the foundations for co-operation to end the people smuggling trade. ,35,TimOfAltona
4155,A successful trip at any examination and has laid the groundwork for improved co-operation from Indonesia on people smuggling and also set in motion an increase in trade and investment. ,31,TimOfAltona
4156,Wrong again - he took 21 Australian business leaders with him to discuss trade and investment opportunities. The visit was a lot more than people smugglers even though that's all you choose to focus on.,35,TimOfAltona
4157,The formation of a new Indonesian Centre of Excellence at both Monash University and ANU in Canberra. This is to promote stronger cultural and educational ties between the two nations at University level. ,34,TimOfAltona
4158,"Like so many other Labor cheersquadders in this forum, it matters not what Abbott does or does not say - you are hell bent on retribution because he crushed Labor on Sept 07 so he must now pay for that. ",41,TimOfAltona
4159,"If she was all those things you say, how is it Australian voters wholly rejected her and her own party saw fit to knife her in the back to get rid of her? ",34,TimOfAltona
4160,Now c'mon Jesse - come clean with the Australian people - you &amp; I know that it matters little what Abbott says or how he conducts himself in Indonesia - all you want to do is vilify him at any opportunity that presents itself. ,45,TimOfAltona
4161,"Also, it'll be interesting to see how much new investment flows through as a result of the visit - with 20 of Australia's top business leaders accompanying him we have a formidable presence up there to kick start new trade initiatives - something even the Labor vilifiers on here would agree is a good thing. ",56,TimOfAltona
4162,She may have come across that way - but she is still a failed PM who was knifed by her own party because she was leading them into political oblivion.  ,32,TimOfAltona
4163,"Linda, time to hang up the precious gloves and move on. Gillard attracted criticism because she was a bad PM - not because she was female. Howard was subjected to all manner of personal abuse - not because he was male, because he was PM. ",46,TimOfAltona
4164,Gillard played the gender card as a smoke screen tactic to disguise her massive unpopularity with the electorate. She was wholly a bad PM and the electorate could see right through her - this is why her party knifed her - not because of her gender - because she was a bad PM leading Labor into political oblivion.,58,TimOfAltona
4165,I didn't say there were no men there - I simply stated that it was a feminist evening and men were not welcome. Perhaps those that we saw were 'token' men?,31,TimOfAltona
4166,Funny how she did not mention once last night that the whole misogyny thing was a tactic cooked up by her chief spin doctor McTernan as a ploy to try and turn around her dismal popularity ratings.  ,39,TimOfAltona
4167,Yep good comment. Whether it's Labor or Liberal in govt Indonesia have done the wrong thing by Australia over this for years and it's time they started shouldering more of the responsibility. ,33,TimOfAltona
4168,"Hell, I even heard one Indonesian politician on the news today propose that Indonesia should be doing MORE to assist the asylum seekers get on the boats to Australia. ",30,TimOfAltona

4171,"Even if he was to resign as AG, which he won't, he would be replaced and the Abbott govt continues on with it's first term in office. Brandis departing the AG portfolio changes nothing and certainly won't change the fact that Labor are out of office for the next 9 years at least. ",54,TimOfAltona
4172,ozlander - you are incorrect about Indonesia's search and rescue capability. The RAN have donated a number (not certain how many) patrol boats to work in ant-people smuggling duties. ,30,TimOfAltona
4173,There will be a lot of ticks and a lot of tocks between now and the 2022 election when the ALP may be in a position to offer a viable alternative Govt under LOTO Paul Howes. ,37,TimOfAltona
4174,Brandis staying or going will make no difference to the fact the Coalition are in Govt for many long years ahead and will have zero impact on Labor's very long period in the political wilderness. ,36,TimOfAltona
4175,"Apart from the Labor supporters on here who seem to celebrate boat arrivals since Sept 7, I think it's fair to say that all decent Australians will be hoping the Coalition are successful with Operation Sovereign Borders.",37,TimOfAltona
4176,"Who created the perfect business model for people smugglers which has seen hundreds of boats, thousands of asylum seekers and 1500 or so drownings since 2007 - was that Tony Abbott? ",32,TimOfAltona
4177,Or perhaps you only wanted a Labor government to stop them (given they started them) and now only want to see the Coalition fail - which means potentially hundreds more deaths at sea. ,34,TimOfAltona
4178,About time you started to back the Coalition to shut down the people smugglers - or is it just going to give you so much pleasure every time a boat arrives or sinks with lives lost?,36,TimOfAltona
4179,"This only seems to be of importance to the Labor/Greens cheer squad - apart from the small group of whingers on here, I don't think many people could give a toss whether Abbott spoke to the media at the Grand Final breakfast or not. ",45,TimOfAltona
4180,Never fear Labor losers - there will be plenty of media surrounding the two day Indonesian visit and you'll have plenty of opportunity to vilify every word he utters and do your best to frustrate the Coalition's attempts to shut down the people smugglers. Over to you.,47,TimOfAltona
4181,"Perhaps if the police and military, instead of taking bribes and waving the boats off at the pier, were to actually stop them and arrest the crews and perhaps lock up the local smuggling organisers then that would be a step in the right direction. ",46,TimOfAltona
4182,The most accurate reports indicate the boat had made it out to around 24 nautical miles off the Javanese coast (still inside Indonesian territorial waters) and headed back to the Javanese coast upon running out of fuel. It made it's way back to the coast of Java where it sank some 50-100 metres off shore in stormy seas. ,59,TimOfAltona
4183,"They were only contacting Australian authorities (as they all do) because they wanted Australia to come and rescue them and take them to Christmas Island.

4188,I think you are a bit confused by all this. Obama is staying in the US due to the US Govt shutdown - has nothing to do with not wanting to meet with 20 odd other heads of state in Bali. ,42,TimOfAltona

4190,"Consider this - Abbott will be meeting with the leaders of China, Canada, Japan, Russia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, New Guinea, Philippines, Brunei, Chile, Peru, Vietnam, Mexico, NZ, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and not forgetting his newly forged friendship with Indonesian President. ",44,TimOfAltona
4191,"Plenty of world leaders to be rubbing shoulders with and strengthening ties - don't despair Labor/Greens Cheer Squadders, Prime Minister Abbott will be meeting with the US President several times in the years ahead.",34,TimOfAltona
4192,Actually he did really well in Indonesia. Clearly upsets the Labor/Greens cheer squadders who so desperately wanted things to go wrong and are all cut up because the first overseas visit went so well. ,35,TimOfAltona
4193,"Now c'mon - you know Swan was the worst Treasurer for many a long year - the guy was a goose - how many times did he and Gillard repeat the mantra ""The budget will return to surplus under this government"". ",42,TimOfAltona
4194,Who would they prefer? Not one has put up an alternative - all they want to do is attack and rip down because he was appointed by the Coalition government. ,31,TimOfAltona
4195,Had Ziggy been appointed by a Labor government he would have been eminently suitable and the clowns on here would be full of praise because of his aptitude and experience in major telco infrastructure projects. ,36,TimOfAltona
4196,"Bottom line - it does not matter who the Coalition appoint, the Labor/Greens Cheer Squad will blindly rip into them as retribution for their crushing defeat on Sept 07. ",30,TimOfAltona
4197,I think you may be a bit confused and befuddled over what Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said. Perhaps if you read the article slowly or even out loud to yourself you will realise that what you have said is wrong. ,41,TimOfAltona
4198,PM Abbott and Immigration Minister Scott Morrison will be - point I make is that Longwhatever is championing the cause of people arriving by boat being able to automatically settle in Australia - ,34,TimOfAltona
4199,"Great to see the new Coalition government shouldering some responsibility for assisting Syrian refugees without at the same time ""putting the sugar out on the table"" to encourage people smuggling by boat. ",33,TimOfAltona
4200,"Yep, let's open the borders and allow tens of thousands to settle here if they can make it by here by boat from Indonesia - open slather on the high seas - never mind the thousands who will drown in the next few years attempting the crossing. They don''t count huh Longerenong?",52,TimOfAltona
4201,Has a lot to do with the fact that the Australian electorate had enough of a bad Labor government and threw it out of office to make way for a competent government to resolve the problem. ,37,TimOfAltona
4202,"While the Coalition is getting on with the job of implementing and delivering on all the items we elected them to office for, you have to ask - where is Labor? ",32,TimOfAltona
4203,"Just because, thanks to Gillard and Rudd, they are a shadow of their former selves, there is no need to go into hiding like some quivering rabbit down a burrow. ",31,TimOfAltona
4204,"A strong Opposition is good for the country as demonstrated by Tony Abbott and the Coaliton ,who in opposition were holding the government to account for the many failures and chronic dysfunctionality. ",33,TimOfAltona
4205,"So let's hope Labor can pick themselves up out of the gutter of despair and try something, anything, to offer some kind of opposition to a strong and increasingly accomplished government. ",32,TimOfAltona
4206,"Watch out Anthony ""I do enjoy a beer with my mate Craig Thomson after work"" Albanese and Bill ""I support whatever the PM said even though I didn't hear what she said"" Shorten - Rudd's on his way back to save Labor!!!!! ",43,TimOfAltona
4207,"Abbott's coming around to the idea - helped along by his sister, his three daughters and his wife. All he needs is to allow a party room conscience vote.  ",31,TimOfAltona
4208,"Funny thing is I recall a fair chunk of the Labor MPs voted against it last time, but with the numbers the Coalition have in the Lower House it should make it through (I think a big number of Coalition MPs will vote for it) - The upper house should see it through. ",54,TimOfAltona
4209,I reiterate - I doubt this will get a look in in the first term - too many other distractions - but I would even guess that Abbott may do a Rudd before the next election and agree to a conscience vote if the coalition is re-elected (to match whoever is ALP Leader at the time making the same commitment). ,61,TimOfAltona
4210,"The other push factor for Abbott is that his mate, conservative PM John Key has successfully legislated for it in NZ with little or no back lash - progressive people those Kiwis. ",33,TimOfAltona
4211,"Hapless Labor stuffed around with this for nearly 6 years and churned through the Immigration Ministers while thousands of boats departed Indonesia carrying tens of thousands of people with something like 1,400 people drowning along the way.  ",39,TimOfAltona
4212,"The problem needs to be fixed and the government supported to shutdown people smuggling, stop the drownings and stop the flow of billions of dollars out of the Australian economy which could be going into covering the NDIS, NBN . ",41,TimOfAltona
4213,Reading many of these responses you could be forgiven for thinking the Labor supporters are desperate to see failure with anything PM Abbott initiates so the boats can keep coming and the drownings keep occurring. ,36,TimOfAltona
4214,"LOL - Labor cheer squad spending hours trawling the world's media sites trying to find something, anything at all, that may criticise Abbott's Indonesia visit. Any tidbits they may find in far flung corners of the globe must be true because it says so. ",45,TimOfAltona
4215,Burke and Labor have zero credibility over this whole issue. They started the influx back in 2007 and now it's up to the Coalition to shut the gate and stop the drownings in the ocean. ,36,TimOfAltona
4216,"According to many media reports today a successful trip and has laid the groundwork for improved co-operation from Indonesia on people smuggling and also set in motion an increase in trade, investment and also long overdue tertiary education joint initiatives with Monash Uni and the ANU. ",47,TimOfAltona
4217,"Michael - thanks for re-affirmng the policy - it has always been ""turning around boats where it is safe to do so"" - it has never been ""towing boats back"" The latter came out of Labor/Greens cheer squad hyperventilation and is a false assertion. ",45,TimOfAltona
4218,There are plenty of media reports out today from within Australia and Indonesia hailing the visit a success - perhaps you must have selectively missed them - here is a small cross section from both The Guardian and Fairfax for you to digest - ,45,TimOfAltona
4219,Burke is getting very worried now that the Coalition is making headway with Indonesia over people smuggling - the last thing he wants to see is PM Abbott delivering on his policy to stop the boats departing Indonesia. ,39,TimOfAltona
4220,He needs to acknowledge that progress is being made and get in behind the Coalition and show some support for all that is being done to stamp out the people smuggling operations both here and in Indonesia - Labor's approval rating would actually improve if he was seen to be supportive.,51,TimOfAltona
4221,But they also would have known it would be defeated in Labor's time because of the Coalition party room vote - so why then did'nt they go off and do what they are doing now? ,36,TimOfAltona
4222,"I recall when this was voted on in a private members bill in the Lower House, more Labor MPs voted against, incl Gillard and Rudd. than voted for it. The Coalition vote went along party lines. ",37,TimOfAltona
4223,"Don't assume that even if the Coalition allow a conscience vote on this that it would still get up in the Lower House - it may if enough Coalition MPs back it, but it is not certain by any means. ",41,TimOfAltona
4224,Question - why didn't the ACT Govt go down this path sometime in the last 6 years when Labor were in Govt? Why have they waited until the Coalition are in power (it's not like they couldn't see it coming) with introducing the legislation? ,45,TimOfAltona
4225,"Anything to do with the ACT Labor government not wanting to lock horns with Federal Labor over this, because I suspect Gillard and co would very likely have gone down the same path that Brandis is now.",37,TimOfAltona
4226,"finnigans - no matter how many times you repeat the mantra 'Election now"" or 'Election should be called asap"" it will NEVER change the fact that next federal election is 3 years away. ",34,TimOfAltona
4227,You need to focus your 100 or so posts each day on how Labor are going to rebuild and become a credible opposition to set itself up for government in perhaps the 2022 Federal election. ,36,TimOfAltona
4228,"If they can't find anything in the Australian press, they spend hours trawling through overseas news agencies trying to find something that may reflect badly on the Australian government and Tony Abbott so they can report back here as some kind of victory lap of honour over the government. ",50,TimOfAltona
4229,"Most of them don't give a rats whether it's Ziggy heading up the NBN or Borat, they want to hop on board a theme that gives them a platform to attack the PM at any opportunity, real or imagined. ",40,TimOfAltona
4230,Perhaps the author of this piece would have been better served by actually asking Ziggy for his view on all this and the story line may have turned out very differently. ,32,TimOfAltona
4231,The US Navy SEALS needed to go in there with more fire power to finish the mission. Sounds as if they were under manned and under equipped. They were going in with the permission of the Somali Government - no problem there - a bit more muscle would perhaps have resulted in a win. ,55,TimOfAltona
4232,It's not so much what these guys might be doing in Barawe - it's all about what al-Shabaab are doing in Nairobi and executing children participating in a shopping mall cooking competition.,32,TimOfAltona
4233,"Whoever gets the gig on the weekend, will never be a Labor PM. So best you go for the bloke you least want to lead and wait until the bloke you want to lead becomes ALP leader- he may have the best chance of becoming your next PM - make sense?. ",52,TimOfAltona
4234,"That aside, with the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years behind you, there is a good opportunity for Labor to rebuild, sort out it's factional brawling, dysfunctionality and front bench musical chairs and take up the fight to this government - the country will be a better place with a strong Opposition keeping the government in check. ",54,TimOfAltona
4235,A shame 90% of the commentators on here only want to focus on Abbott as if that is some kind of cure for Labor's problems and will deliver them government. ,31,TimOfAltona
4236,"Irony is, if they got their wish and Abbott stands aside or is pushed, he is replaced by Malcolm Turnbull which would almost certainly guarantee Labor another 2 terms or so in Opposition.",33,TimOfAltona
4237,"Not at all - I'm pointing out as I have throughout this thread that this issue affects both sides of parliament, not just Tony Abbott and the Coalition as around 95% of the commentators on here would have us believe. ",41,TimOfAltona
4238,The point is also that what Swan did and what Abbott did are within the rules of parliamentary travel expenses as they stand today and there is plenty of ambiguity swirling around which needs to be addressed. ,38,TimOfAltona
4239,"WAYNE Swan charged taxpayers more than $12,000 to fly him and two of his children to the AFL Grand final by VIP jet when he was acting prime minister in 2010. 
The following day the then treasurer and his advisers took a taxpayer-funded RAAF flight from Brisbane to Sydney to watch the NRL Grand Final. 
The Australian has checked Mr Swan's travel records, confirming he took the trips on October 2 and October 3, 2010. ",76,TimOfAltona
4240,"I could be mistaken, but you sound as if you may not have voted for the Liberal or National party in the last election - good thing the majority of Australians' did don't you think? ",36,TimOfAltona
4241,"If you happened not to have voted for Abbott in the last election there is plenty of time, around 3 years, for you to change your mind, c'mon over to the winning team and re-elect the Coalition for another 3 year term in 2016. ",45,TimOfAltona
4242,"There is now a good opportunity for Labor to rebuild, sort out it's factional brawling and take up the fight to the government - Australia will be a better place with a strong Opposition keeping the government in check. ",40,TimOfAltona
4243,"A shame 90% of the commentators on here only want to focus on Abbott as if that is some kind of cure for Labor's problems and will deliver them government. It won't, Abbott is too savvy and will survive and each year he survives he will be getting stronger in the role. ",53,TimOfAltona
4244,"Irony is, if they got their wish and Abbott stands aside one day he is replaced by Turnbull which would almost certainly guarantee Labor another 2 terms or so in Opposition.",31,TimOfAltona
4245,He was there on holiday with his family. He went to the hospital and as he was health minister at the time he used his fairly powerful position to organise emergency evacuations forwounded Australians and others. Reports are he spent many hours at the hospital with victims over the following days.,51,TimOfAltona
4246,Not rattled at all Marge - perfectly calm. Just pointing out the stupidity of some of the Labor posters on here and their outrageous and often twisted comments making them look a tad loopy. ,35,TimOfAltona
4247,You forget that Abbott was in Kuta when the Bali bombing occurred and he spent days working in the local hospital comforting and doing what he could for the victims - he personally arranged evacuations back to Australia and Singapore for some of the more seriously wounded. ,48,TimOfAltona
4248,This is the problem when you get a herd of rabid Labor cheer squadders together on the same thread - they all try to outdo each other with their outlandish claims and you end up with a comment like your one.  ,43,TimOfAltona
4249,"I ask the question again...........where is Labor on all this. Going by the comments on here you would be thinking that the Opposition party would be all over this like a rash........but no, it's only he over excited Labor cheer squadders on this thread. ",45,TimOfAltona
4250,Labor have been in govt for 6 years and nothing was done about this issue at all - in fact all I hear is that they will be assisting the govt to clear up the travel expense ambiguities. ,39,TimOfAltona
4251,You guys should follow the lead of your own party and settle down a tad - it can't be healthy to get yourselves so worked up......burst blood vessels and all that. ,32,TimOfAltona
4252,"Errrrr......no - the frenzied sharks are a handful, around 8 or so Labor/Greens cheer squadders on Guardian threads who post around 20-30 comments a day - it makes it look there are more of them when there aren't! ",39,TimOfAltona
4253,"How is it that your beloved Labor Party are silent on this matter? Surely if there were such grave injustices, wide scale fraud and all the lies and dishonesty that everyone here are claiming then Labor would be all over this like a rash. ",45,TimOfAltona
4254,"Oh that's right, there isn't any because it's only the Labor/Greens cheer squadders on here who think they are on a winner in their relentless quest to vilify the PM who threw Labor (with a bit of help from Gillard and Rudd) into the political gutter - no one else. ",51,TimOfAltona
4255,Perhaps it's time you gave up on this nonsense and started focussing on where Labor are headed and how they can turn themselves into a viable opposition before the 2016 election?,31,TimOfAltona
4256,I think you have got yourself all muddled and confused - he claims nothing for his volunteering at the SLSC or the NSW Rural Fire Brigade. I suspect you just made those two up as you went along because it blends in well with all the other vilification going on in this thread. ,54,TimOfAltona
4257,I think you may be a bit confused by all the Labor/Greens rhetroic over this. Abbott is not being paid appearance money. He has claimed travel and accommodation expenses that he paid out personally to attend in his capacity as a high profile MP.  ,46,TimOfAltona
4258,Funny how Labor Cheer squad only want to vilify Tony Abbott on this subject - completely ignoring Labor pollies involved in this (presumably because they can do no wrong). ,30,TimOfAltona
4259,Yet another Labor/Greens cheer squadder in denial that Gillard toppled Rudd and then Rudd knifed Gillard and the whole ALP parliamentary party was racked with division and hatred - these are facts.,32,TimOfAltona
4260,Abbott has some 8 commercial logos on his cycling gear - Labor cheer squad spend hours trawling through the corporate names on the internet to try to find a name that may have a smidgen of negative connotations so they can report back to the Guardian thread on their findings. ,51,TimOfAltona
4261,Newsflash losers! Get over your obsession with Tony Abbott. It's getting way too unhealthy. How about you focus your energies on how the ALP are going to rebuild after their devastating loss at the election. ,36,TimOfAltona
4262,"Focussing on PM Abbott and ignoring the dysfunctionality in Labor won't win you the election. Perhaps you should be discussing Kevin Rudd's return to the Labor leadership or Albo's 'afterwork' drinking buddy Craig Thomson or Bill ""I agree with the PM whatever she said even though I did'nt hear what she said"" Shorten.",53,TimOfAltona
4263,I assume your point is that Tony Abbott and other MP's should personally pay for their own travel and accommodation when attending events in their capacity as MPs.  ,30,TimOfAltona
4264,Speaking of Where's Wally? - Where's anyone from Labor these days? Still hiding down their burrow from the election loss it seems. Wonder when they will emerge and become a credible opposition?  ,34,TimOfAltona
4265,According to the rules around claiming parliamentary travel expenses he claims back through the Treasury office for the costs he personally incurred for flights and accommodation - all above board and within the rules as they stand today. He did not take money from the charity as you are implying with your Labor tinted glasses on. ,57,TimOfAltona
4266,Errrr...I don't think Labor have any choice but work with the government on this - the last thing Shorten or Albo want is for all the Labor MP repayments to make it into the press. ,36,TimOfAltona
4267,Tony Abbott for many years has been invited to participate in numerous sporting/charity events all over the country in his capacity as a high profile Liberal politician. These invitations skyrocketed when he became LOTO. ,35,TimOfAltona
4268,If he was Joe Blow public he would not have been invited to participate by the event organisers and if he wanted to go he would have to find his own way there and pay for all his own accommodation etc. ,42,TimOfAltona
4269,Within the parliamentary travel expense rules he is permitted to lawfully claim for his travel expenses when engaged in travel related to his parliamentary role/duties - in this case attending to worthwhile community/charity events.  ,36,TimOfAltona
4270,"Certainly some ambiguity exists around these rules and certainly wedding attendances are probably stretching the boundaries - although these were repaid accordingly, but nothing unlawful has occurred here (as much as you desperately want there to be). ",38,TimOfAltona
4271,"Pollies from all sides, including high profile independents have been caught up in this, so the best thing the Abbott government can do is have a review of the whole travel allowance rules and remove the ambiguity. ",38,TimOfAltona
4272," Still got 3 years to go and very likely another 3 after that - no first term government has lost the following election in something like 80 years, even though Rudd did his very best to get Gillard/Labor out of office in the 2010 election and very nearly succeeded.",50,TimOfAltona
4273,"You are right that there are probably many pollies from all parties who have been caught up in this and the vast majority will have claimed within the rules albeit some ambiguity exists, including Abbott. ",36,TimOfAltona
4274,Xenophon's suggested solution has some merit but it was interesting to note that he too has had to pay back incorrectly claimed travel expenses in the past to which he freely admits (7.30 report tonight) ,36,TimOfAltona
4275,"All these posts calling for the blood of Abbott are a little exuberant, given a host of Labor pollies have/will have to also pay back claimseg:Attorny General Richard Dreyfus for his 2 nights at a ski lodge he claimed were in a hotel in Canberra (he did say it was an admin error) and has repaid the money.",58,TimOfAltona
4276,"Well, get used to it pal, Prime Minister Abbott is around for a long long time - perhaps you may be better off moving to a country that has Westminster system ties with Australia but with a Labor/Greens government - let me see now ",45,TimOfAltona
4277,Your problem is that it's Tony Abbott who is doing the charity work so you can't stand him being seen to do anything that people may actually agree with or thank him. ,33,TimOfAltona
4278,It's all bitter and twistedness (is there even such a word?) from the Labor/Greens cheer squad on here who only want to vilify everything Abbott says or dies as payback for Labor's thrashing at the Sept 7 polls.,38,TimOfAltona
4279,Actually I think you could be wrong there - I once saw an episode of Star Trek where they were in a galaxy far far away and they came across a planet run by the Klingons on the planet Alpha Santoris - now there was a bad government! The Coalition have nothing on those guys.,55,TimOfAltona
4280,There is not much to see here. Even Labor acknowledge that they won't pursue this any further other than to strongly suggest the government revisit the rules and guidelines relating to travel reimbursement. ,34,TimOfAltona
4281,This is probably due the fact that any major investigation will probably unearth a plethora of Labor pollies caught up over the same issue - I think the former Attorney General Dreyfus got caught up in this today by claiming expenses for accommodation in Canberra when he was actually at a ski resort (he says it was an administrative error) and has today repaid the money.  ,68,TimOfAltona
4282,"I notice the Labor cheer squad got themselves all worked up into some kind of cosmic lather today calling for Abbott to be aken out and publicly flogged - nice try guys, but at the end of the day nothing to see here.",43,TimOfAltona
4283,Now you know your figures are a load of crap which don't show a whole lot of costs for Julia Gillard - you Labor/Greens cheer squadders do manipulate data don't you? ,32,TimOfAltona
4284,"How do you expect Abbott to travel around Australia as LOTO - pretty much has to get onto a plane,while Gillard travels around in an airforce VIP 737 at a cost of around $1.5m per year. ",37,TimOfAltona
4285,Great to see PM Tony Abbott improving relations with Malaysia. These are important steps forward for our relations with Malaysia and will assist with trade relations along with other benefits. ,31,TimOfAltona
4286,Yiou Labor/Greens cheer squadders are hopeless - trying to whip up something that does not exist. I guess it gives you a little bit of satisfaction for the crushing of Labor on Sept 07. ,35,TimOfAltona
4287,"All media outlets, print, radio &amp; TV were reporting and providing oxygen to those issues - not just News Ltd. Were you reading the Fairfax and ABC reports?  You are so self-consumed and obssessed with News Ltd it's gotta be unhealthy.

Of course not.",81,TimOfAltona

You know this is one of his passions - he's been going up to indigenous communities for something like 15 years now - way before media were showing any interest. Saying he only goes up there for photo opportunities really highlights your partisan ignorance. ,75,TimOfAltona
4316,I think you'll find that over the next 3 years Abbott will do more for indigenous matters than any other PM - he is totally committed to this cause. ,30,TimOfAltona

4323,For the past 4 years or so the word 'poll' would not have passed their lips or been typed out on their keyboard so afraid were they of the results which showed labor were heading for political annihilation. ,39,TimOfAltona
4324,Now all of a sudden after TWO polls reflecting something positive for Labor they are screaming the word 'polls' from the rooftops and dancing a jig around the light on the hill. ,33,TimOfAltona
4325,Newsflash cheer squadders - there are still hundreds of polls to go before now and the next election - plenty of time for the dysfunctionality and division to bubble back up to the surface and ensure Labor stay in Opposition for another 2 or 3 terms. ,47,TimOfAltona

4331,"Actually no I retract that - Plibersek won't make the cut after the Gillard experiment - by that I mean the ALP always turn to women when the males stuff things up, Kirner, Bligh, Keneally et al and it has always ended in disaster for one reason and another.",49,TimOfAltona
4332,Katharine is spot when she says rank and file members will feel a little cheated over this outcome but should find solace in the fact that Albo from here probably has a much better chance of being the next Labor PM than Shorten. ,44,TimOfAltona

4338,He will never be a Labor PM - he's merely warming the seat for someone else - the ALP are likely to go through 2 or 3 leaders before they can take a credible alternative government into an election - my guess it'll be Paul Howse in 2022.,48,TimOfAltona

Where ambiguity exists, some repayments have been made, by Labor (Gillard), Coalition (Abbott) and Independents (Xenophon). ",48,TimOfAltona
4345,I think if Albo gets in he will be seriously looking at Rudd for Shadow Foreign Minister - Albo and Rudd go back a long way and Albo was part of the Bowen/Fitzgibbon cabal pushing for Rudd's return ever since Gillard took over the leadership as we know. ,49,TimOfAltona

",85,TimOfAltona
4349,You see right here is the problem on these threads - with so many Labor cheer squadders trying to outdo each other with outlandish and vacuous comments you end up with comments like this one from Longwhatever. ,38,TimOfAltona
4350,"One day I might just list some of the vindictive and vengeful comments made by the Left ranging from (only 2 days ago) ""Tony Abbott was responsible for the Bali bombings and has the death of 92 Australians on his hands"" through to (3 weeks ago) ""Tony Abbott was paying people smugglers to get people onto boats that would be deliberately sunk to cause drownings so he could get elected"" ",71,TimOfAltona
4351,Not true - let's get back to the basics - both Labor and the Coalition are trying to stop the boats departing Indonesia - none of us want to see drownings at sea - the Coalition are going about it their way and I think we should give them a go and support any initiative that halts or severely curtails boat departures. ,63,TimOfAltona
4352,"If you don't support the government's initiatives in Operation Sovereign Borders then in the absence of a better plan, you must be in favor of people risking the voyage by boat. ",32,TimOfAltona
4353,Your support for the government's initiatives is commendable. They are doing all they can to stop these boats departing Indonesia in the first place. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has just returned from another visit to Indonesia where he met with senior Indonesian govt officials in working with them for more co-operation in preventing boat departures. ,56,TimOfAltona
4354,"LOL - from the afternoon of the swearing in of the new government thefinnigans has been screaming out several times a day ""call an election now"" - in fact I recall he was claiming on a daily basis that ""this is the worst government ever"" even before the government was sworn in!!  ",54,TimOfAltona
4355,I don't think it has even occurred to him that a) Labor has no leader to go to an election with and b) that an Australian Federal Government runs a term of 3 years - we do not call federal elections every few weeks. ,45,TimOfAltona

4357,"My take on this is that most people complaining about this on here, alan included, don't really give a rats arse whether they hear about people in detention attempting self harm or not. They just see this as another chance to take another swing at the government and try and push their anti-Abbott rhetoric on pretty much any subject that comes up. ",63,TimOfAltona
4358,The Coalition are spot-on. These people in detention who attempt self harm will be cared for and megaphoning their action achieves nothing - unless you are a Labor cheer squad member who think this a great opportunity to once again criticise the government.,43,TimOfAltona
4359,So an extension of what your are saying is that anyone who attempts self harm while in detention or custody in Australia should have their action publicised in the media? ,31,TimOfAltona
4360,"Ok - each day in Australian prisons somewhere around 10 people attempt self harm in one form or another - let's have these reported each day in the media, just so everything is transparent and the governments are not hiding anything and the population informed.",45,TimOfAltona
4361,I think you have got a bit confused - Morrison said it was never government policy to tow back the boats - not turn back the boats as you claim. ,31,TimOfAltona
4362,We are dealing with desperate people here and unfortunately some of these people may be encouraged to engage in these acts if they feel they will receive media exposure as a result. ,33,TimOfAltona
4363,There's a fantastic article on Chris Bowen (recently acting Leader of the ALP) and how he is defending Kevin Rudd against Roxon's attack and thinks Kevin is around for the long term. ,33,TimOfAltona
4364,"I want to make one glaring observation regarding the comments, hundreds if not thousands of them posted in these threads by the Labor cheer squad during the election campaign. ",30,TimOfAltona
4365,"Every comment posted was a personal attack on Tony Abbott - nothing was mentioned about Rudd at all. No one defending him, saying he was doing a good job or was a great leader for Labor - everyone was totally obsessed with Tony Abbott.  ",46,TimOfAltona
4366,You keep on saying Gillard should never have been removed - obviously the rant of a masochist who delights in seeing Labor wiped out the election and coming away with 30 something seats.,33,TimOfAltona
4367,"So while the Labor cheer squad tear each other apart (just like their party) over Roxon's speech, the government is getting on with the business of governing and getting us out of the mess that 6 years of a divided and dysfunctional Labor government created for this country.",48,TimOfAltona
4368,Daisy - Gillard and Roxon conspired to put her into a role Gillard knew full well she was going to pull the pin on before the election.This enabled Roxon to preserve her hefty ministerial pension which would otherwise have been dramatically reduced had she stayed around for the election and either gone into opposition or lost her seat.It was a stich up by Gillard looking after her friend.,68,TimOfAltona
4369,You are wrong - the Coalition are very much in tune with people in the real world - why do you think they have such a large supporter base in former Labor strong holds like Western Sydney? ,38,TimOfAltona
4370,One of the many challenges labor is facing is that Rudd is still there and he has a group of senior party members (most of them we know) who want to see him re-installed as Leader some time down the track. ,42,TimOfAltona
4371,That scenario is not out of the question when Shorten's polling starts to point south and Rudd's is pointing north once more. The very rules Rudd brought in to protect his own leadership do allow for leadership change under certain circumstances. ,42,TimOfAltona
4372,"This is exactly why Labor are in the political wilderness - they look the other way when it comes to criticism and the failings of their own party and instead of facing up to it, they try and sweep it under the carpet and hope people don't notice. ",49,TimOfAltona
4373,Labor cheer squad need to acknowledge that things are not going all that well for Labor and perhaps discuss how they can turn it around instead of blindly attacking Tony Abbott 24/7.,32,TimOfAltona
4374,I have a dislike for Roxon because of the way she and Gillard manipulated to get Roxon the AT gig when Gillard knew all along she was only in it for the short term which delivered Roxon a windfall of several hundred thousand dollars she would not have had otherwise. ,51,TimOfAltona
4375,The problem for Labor is if Rudd resigns they will effectively be handing the Coalition another seat in the lower house - Glasson did extraordinarily well in Griffth and will be a shoe in at a by-election.,37,TimOfAltona
4376,Anotht labor cheer squadder who wants all the blame for Labor's demise to sit at the feet of the media - has no clue that Labor actually did themselves in.,30,TimOfAltona

4380,"Had Murdoch supported Rudd and Labor had won all of you, every single one of you, would be silent on this. In your eyes Rupert could do no wrong - he would be your hero, a favourite son of the Labor party. ",43,TimOfAltona
4381,Or have I got it wrong and you would all still be flooding these threads condemning Murdoch for giving Labor an unfair advantage over the Coalition and should pull his head in and give the Coalition a chance? ,39,TimOfAltona
4382,Where's all the money to pay for all that? This was the problem all along - Labor spent all the money and kept borrowing billions to pay for things the country couldn't afford. ,34,TimOfAltona

4409,"1. Flicking Steve Bracks from the NY Consul General post so quickly and without announcing who would replace him - the decision would easily backfire if they didn't have someone of the calibre of Bracks to replace him.2. Using the term 'mandate' when it comes to climate change and elimination of carbon tax. Nothing raises hackles more than a government claiming a mandate. It does not wash and is easily shot down in flames.3. Tony Abbott should be taking a harder line on the MP travel expense claim mess. Member's from both sides of parliament have been caught up in this and with opposition support which Bowen offered, the government should review the rules around entitlements and have the ambiguity removed. This will go a long way to changing negative views on politicians. Before everyone jumps on the government for 'allowing' this to happen - remember we have just emerged from 6 years of Labor government where bugger all was done about it as well. It's up to the Coalition to fix it up from here.",176,TimOfAltona
4410,Not sure the public execution of two Iranian men from a crane in a carpark I came across on the outskirts of Tabriz a few years ago left me feeling any great affection for the country. Not a pleasant experience and makes you reflect on how hardline Islamic countries treat their citizens who transgress. I am not certain of their crime but bystanders told my Iranian friend they thought the men were drug traffickers - they looked like they were only about 20 years old. ,86,TimOfAltona
4411,This is the kind of news the Labor cheer squad can't stand. It eats them up to see the Coalition are significantly better fiscal managers than Labor and the Greens combined. ,32,TimOfAltona

",54,TimOfAltona

4437,He knew exactly the state of play and conned us all. He knew the gig was up for Labor months out from the election yet kept insisting he was in for the whole term. ,35,TimOfAltona
4438,Previously he has stated several times that climate change is real and is caused by human activity. If I have to go and find the links to all that I will. Just google it and it will appear before you.,40,TimOfAltona
4439,The point you miss is that Australia's population was a fraction n the 1800's of where it is today and also back then there was not the migration of communities into the bush fire prone areas that we have today (man meets bush). ,44,TimOfAltona
4440,Had that been the case the major fires in the 1800's would very likely have claimed the same number of lives or more that we see much smaller fires today. ,31,TimOfAltona
4441,Many of the commentators on here seem to have got themselves a bit confused or muddled up in the heat of the debate - Abbott has never said climate change is not real - he has said it is real and it's happening and that it is a man made phenomena. ,52,TimOfAltona
4442,Now that we have that straight - it is the Coalition's path to addressing the problem that a) they went to an election on and won with a 35 seat majority and b) may differ from the views of some on here (who want a price on carbon) that seems to challenge the minds of the Labor/Greens cheer squad. ,60,TimOfAltona
4443,"Constant streams of abuse and vilification hurled at PM Tony Abbott achieves nothing.It will not morph the government into Labor overnight, it will not bring on another election and it will not fix the crippling internal problems of Labor by making them miraculously disappear. ",45,TimOfAltona
4444,There is some validity to Tony Abbott's remarks. Bush fires have always and will always be a part of the Australian landscape - many of the largest fires recorded since European settlement were in the 1800's. Not sure there was too much global warming going on in 1857? (Australia's largest ever recorded bush fire). ,55,TimOfAltona
4445, Figueres is a disciple of Al Gore and there is every likelihood given the scope of her comments she was briefed by Milne or Bandt which initiated her press release.,31,TimOfAltona
4446,Wrong - you obviously have not read the result of the last federal election where both parties made their intentions on this issue very clear well before polling day. ,30,TimOfAltona
4447,Rudd in what he thought would be a grab for votes by 'changing his mind' on the issue and should he be elected would put another bill before the parliament. ,31,TimOfAltona
4448,Let's just face reality - it matters not whom the Coalition appoint Speaker - you will still attack and vilify in your usual manner because it is a Coalition MP sitting in the chair and not a Labor one. ,40,TimOfAltona
4449,The suggestion that the government has to wait until a natural disaster has to subside before it makes announcements is ludicrous also from what I've seen this has had plenty of media attention alongside the fires. ,37,TimOfAltona
4450,Instead of the Labor cheer squad blindly shooting down everything this government does - perhaps it's best they await the commission outcomes next year so they can base their arguments on fact not the usual baseless anti-government cut and paste rhetoric. ,42,TimOfAltona
4451,Newman is turning the state of QLD around after the disaster that was the Bligh government. Labor baton twirlers don't like it because it proves all their doomsday prophecies have been shot to pieces. ,35,TimOfAltona
4452,Oh by that you mean we don't see the PM on TV every few hours trying to explain away another self inflicted crisis or stuff up as Gillard was doing? ,31,TimOfAltona
4453,Abbott's quietly getting on with the job of governing and doesn't need to be in front of the TV cameras every few hours. No need to when everything is under control by a good government.,35,TimOfAltona
4454,You seem to be incapable of posting a comment without throwing in a personal or vilifying slur - which by the way is more of a reflection on you than your intended victim. ,34,TimOfAltona
4455," Doubt there will be any state governments, Labor or Liberal who would stand in the way of an increase however the federal government has vowed not to tinker with the GST without first taking it to an election as Howard did. ",43,TimOfAltona
4456,"The whole idea is that we discourage people from getting onto unseaworthy boats in Indonesia and making the journey to Australia risking their lives and possibly adding to the roughly 1,500 people who have drowned since Labor dismantled the Pacific Solution. ",42,TimOfAltona
4457,Daisy I keep correcting cheer squadders who claim Abbott was out with the media - he was not. There was no media there. Any photos you saw were from files - media used them because they had nothing to show otherwise. ,42,TimOfAltona
4458,"I may be thinking a little out of the square, but it may not be climate change causing these bush fires - could it be the people with matches who light them? ",33,TimOfAltona
4459,"People taking photos with mobile phones are not the media. You know that. In any case, why would'nt other fireys want a photo of Abbott - it's not everyday you see the PM of Australia fighting bush fires shoulder to shoulder with other fire fighters? Makes him rather unique and is commended. ",53,TimOfAltona
4460,Unfortunately you have managed to get yourself all muddled up and confused. There was no media present when Abbott was out for 14 hours with the fire crews doing back burning work. ,33,TimOfAltona
4461,He actually spent 14 hours doing back burning in the fires yesterday. There was no media around to capture the event - despite the cheer squad in their usual ignorance claiming he only did it for a photo opportunity. ,40,TimOfAltona
4462,He is not 'posing' in a RFS uniform - he is a RFS member and has been for over 15 years. He spent 14 hours back burning yesterday to help out people like you. ,35,TimOfAltona
4463,"Looking at the comments below, I reckon the cheer squad need to lay down their pom poms and get in behind the efforts of fire fighters and residents battling these fires. ",32,TimOfAltona
4464,"Jealousy of our PM will get you no where. Just because he's a better PM than anything the failed Labor party could muster, no need to display your inadequacies by hiding behind failed Labor rhetoric.  ",37,TimOfAltona
4465,The 'photos' - all 2 of them - came from the phones of his fellow fireries who wanted to record the moment - after all it is not every day that the PM of Australia works shoulder to shoulder with fire fighters out in the bush. ,47,TimOfAltona
4466,"It's pretty clear you are just itching to come right out and say these fires are Tony Abbott's fault. You are drooling at the prospect that somehow you can pin these fires on the PM, just as another Labor cheer squad member yesterday was desperately trying to construct a link between Abbott and Adolf Hitler through Robert Menzies and a few weeks ago another was asserting Tony Abbott prior to the election was actually paying people smugglers to put asylum seekers on boats in the hope there would be drownings to try and bring down the Labor government. ",99,TimOfAltona
4467,"Has it not dawned on you yet that Labor lost the election because they were a bad government and sections of the media were calling it for what it was - a bad, dysfunctional and divided government. Not rocket science, just a government and a party that lost it's way. ",51,TimOfAltona
4468,Time to change tactics - vilifying Abbott does not work. You need to spend time on sorting out the mess Labor is in and how they can try and rebuild over the years ahead. You never know you might get government back in 2022?,44,TimOfAltona
4469,No one is suggesting it was Rudd's fault - it was the haste the Labor government tried to roll it out to gain electoral favor against the advice of the experts.  ,33,TimOfAltona
4470,"Tick tock tick tock - the clock is counting down to the Coalition re-election in 2016. If you don't believe me, check out what the betting agencies are saying - Labor looks finished and it is.",36,TimOfAltona
4471,"Tell that to the families of the boys who died. They have never received answers on the circumstances surrounding their sons' deaths, Rudd had it shut down. This will force Rudd to reveal what really happened and give the families some closure.",42,TimOfAltona
4472,You do realise that you're pretty much on your own with this one - I doubt any of your fellow cheer squadders would even want to touch something as rancid as what you are spruiking here.,36,TimOfAltona
4473,"Yes, I notice the betting agencies who are rarely wrong on election outcomes have Labor to win in Victoria at $2.50 and the Coalition at $1.50. That certainly back's up your claim beautifully. ",34,TimOfAltona
4474,"Also, you did not mention SA( Labor at $5.50 and Libs at $1.15) or Tas (Labor at $6.00 Libs at $1.15). Presume you are conceding those to the Liberals. ",30,TimOfAltona
4475,Gee I'd love to know on what basis this country is going down the toilet - apart from the fact that you still feel all bitter and twisted about Labor losing the election and are having a hard time coping with that?,42,TimOfAltona
4476,Oh and on Miranda - yep it was a big swing to the Labor candidate - nothing to to with the ALP which has a toxic brand in NSW and is out of government for many years to come. ,40,TimOfAltona
4477,"Speaking of reciprocity, you omitted to mention that Abbott extended the term of the Rudd appointed GG Quentin Bryce and also turned down her recent offer to resign over the appointment of her son-in-law Bill Shorten to the leadership of the ALP. It also seems you somehow 'overlooked' the fact that former ALP leader Kim Beazley is still our US Ambassador to Washington - probably the most politically charged overseas posting - and will remain there until further notice. ",80,TimOfAltona
4478,I don't see what all the fuss is about? The only people who seem 'offended' by this are the usual random assortment of Labor cheer squadders who blindly pour cut and paste vindictive scorn on Tony Abbott as soon as his name is mentioned. ,45,TimOfAltona
4479,Gets a bit tedious and makes you wonder of they can keep this hysteria surrounding their crushing defeat at the polls going for another 9 years or more of a Coaltion government in this country. My guess is no.,39,TimOfAltona
4480,"Looks like in your haste to pour vindictive scorn over anything the government does, you omitted to mention that the government extended the term of the Rudd appointed GG Quentin Bryce and also turned down her recent offer to resign over the appointment of her son-in-law Bill Shorten to the leadership of the ALP. It also seems you somehow 'overlooked' the fact that Kim Beazley is still our US Ambassador to Washington - probably the most politically charged overseas posting - and will remain there until his term is completed. ",91,TimOfAltona
4481,Not sure what your point is- are you saying labor really won the election and through some weird osmosis the Labor government morphed into the Coalition government or are you just talking through your hat as usual? ,38,TimOfAltona
4482,Elaboraterouse's comment is not spot on. She hears one person from Australia make some comments at a dinner party and from that he/she draws the conclusion that all 23.3 million of us are racist?,34,TimOfAltona
4483,dream on cheer squadder - thinking the corrupt NSW ALP will get back into power is delusional in the extreme. Labor are also about to be thrown out of government in Tasmania and South Australia. That will leave how many Labor state governments? You do the math.,47,TimOfAltona
4484,"You can call me wrong, but I could swear that abolition of the mining tax was a signature policy that the Coalition took to the election which in turn delivered them government with a 35 seat majority in the Lower House? ",42,TimOfAltona
4485,"The Coalition won government in a landslide victory with a suite of signature policies. The abolition of the mining tax was one of the policies that people voted the Coalition in to repeal. That is now underway. No surprises, no obfuscation like in the Gillard years, no bullshit just good governance from a strong and united government doing the things they told us they would do before we voted them in. ",72,TimOfAltona
4486,The boat arrivals - if it were not for Tony Abbott there would be no boat arrivals. He is to blame for each boat that makes it to Australia and for those which don't. Every one arriving is Tony Abbott's fault. ,42,TimOfAltona
4487,The bird shit on my windscreen the other day - Tony Abbott is to blame for a bird pooping on my car the other day. Every time a bird poops on your car it is Tony Abbott's fault. ,39,TimOfAltona
4488,The Great Bookie Robbery in 1976 - Tony Abbott is to blame for this criminal event and he was in the Victoria Club that day. If it were not for Tony Abbott this robbery would never have occurred. ,39,TimOfAltona
4489,"Assassination of JFK - definitely Tony Abbott's fault. He was there behind the grassy knoll, you can make his face out quite clearly in the photos. If it were not for Tony Abbott Kennedy would be alive today. ",39,TimOfAltona
4490,Brian's speech at The Press Club was a good insight on how to run an effective and highly successful campaign. Labor should have hit the 'record' button and learnt a thing or two. ,34,TimOfAltona
4491,"While the Libs and Abbott campaigned strongly, I do admit that their task was made so much easier by having the deeply unpopular (mainly within the Labor party themselves) Kevin Rudd running who had in turn knifed the even more deeply unpopular Julia Gillard only weeks before. At least Rudd probably held onto roughly 15 seats more for Labor than had Julia Gillard remained leader.  ",67,TimOfAltona
4492,"So Alan, as chairperson and presumably only member of the Penny Wong Appreciation Society how do you feel about Ms Wong telling the Australian people for years that the budget will be returned to surplus under Labor - guaranteed! ",40,TimOfAltona
4493,"Actually no - Penny Wong is not loved and admired. She was an integral part of the inept Rudd/Gillard/Rudd government, carries a lot of the responsibility for Labor's crushing defeat and is very likely to end her political career on the opposition benches.",43,TimOfAltona
4494," It may be 5 or more years away, but once the public executions start up again, the Afghani women are relegated back to about 6th in the pecking order after sheep, goats and cattle and the Taliban shut down the TV, radio and newspapers (except for their own propaganda), close schools and universities other than for their religion, ban music and summarily stone to death women who have the audacity to be victims of rape then the UN Security Council will take another look and probably sanction intervention once more. ",92,TimOfAltona
4495,"Not a great prognosis for the country, but in my view corruption and tribalism will hasten the state to fail once more and give the Taliban the opening they need to exert their influence beyond the remote rural regions and into the larger urban areas. ",46,TimOfAltona
4496,"Pretty simple - parents need to stop their children from smuggling 'contraband' into the facility in their school bags and there won't be a problem. If the parents won't do that, then the facility authorities have to step in and do the job. ",44,TimOfAltona
4497,I can't see how bag searches are affecting the kids - everyday thousands of children have their bags searched going through airport security check points.Can't see how that may be affecting their learning at school. ,36,TimOfAltona
4498,I think the most bizarre event in the annals of recent Labor history was on Sept 07 at around 9pm when Rudd walked into the ALP election rooms to concede defeat.  ,33,TimOfAltona
4499,"He walked in like he was the messiah who had just delivered Labor a spectacular victory and, short of the crowd falling to their knees and kissing his feet, an outsider looking in would have thought it was a victory speech. ",42,TimOfAltona
4500,"That was just plain wierd - after all the poison, all the hatred, all the dysfunctionality that sat behind Rudd's leadership of the ALP and the tearing apart of the party saw this man heralded by himself and his followers as the victor that evening. ",46,TimOfAltona
4501,I invite you to read the link below - it advises that Labor's primary vote since the election is still falling and the Coalition's is rising. It also advises that the PM's personal popularity is at an all time high not only since he became PM but since he became Liberal leader. ,53,TimOfAltona
4502,The extent of Abbott's unpopularity seems limited to a very tiny cabal on the Guardian threads who live in a world of denial and delusion that somehow by daily vilification of Abbott will see their party returned to government. ,40,TimOfAltona
4503,Newsflash - attacking the PM and sprinkling glitter over the ALP won't result in what you are so desperately seeking. You need to focus your energies on addressing Labor's deeply entrenched disunity and dysfunction. This major problem lies at the heart of Labor's woes and ignoring it will not make it go away. Time for a change of tactics cheer squadders!  ,63,TimOfAltona
4504,Good to see the Coalition looking at all options. The debt level left behind by Labor is so high a responsible government will examine all options which may assist alleviate debt. They will examine the UK experience and see if it has any possibility for Australia. It may or it may not.  ,54,TimOfAltona
4505,I think if you go back you will see that Abbott announced this way before the election - no point hiding your head in the sand and pretending you've only just heard of this action.  ,37,TimOfAltona
4506,The Mexican government is too weak to deal with this on their own. Corruption and threat of death allows the cartels to operate almost with impunity in several areas of the country. ,33,TimOfAltona
4507,"Time for the US to step up and provide more assets to assist Mexico and time for the Mexican government to allow more practical assistance from the US - particularly in extreme violence hotspots like Cuidad Juarez which has the world's highest drug cartel related homicide rate, right across the border from El Paso. Beheadings and bodies hung from bridges is a daily affair.",64,TimOfAltona
4508,"You may be correct she is held in relative high esteem, but be under no illusion that her ineptness as Australian PM when it came to domestic issues did not escape the attention of the US and Chinese administrations. ",40,TimOfAltona
4509,"Irony is, Rudd probably did Gillard's post-political aspirations a favor by removing her before the election. Labor left holding around 35 seats would not have been a good look for her.",31,TimOfAltona
4510,Perhaps it's best if you read the entire interview transcript and you will notice fairly quickly that he covered a broad range of issues - not just a few remarks about the inept Labor government he replaced.,37,TimOfAltona
4511,"Don't agree with some of your assertions but the fact is it did not matter if Gillard was male or female, a deeply unpopular leader is going to cop flack. ",31,TimOfAltona
4512,"Gillard and McTernan were able to play the confected misogyny card to try and deflect her detractors, but the public saw through their subterfuge and the whole house of cards eventually tumbled down. ",34,TimOfAltona
4513,"I don't agree with some of your assertions, but at the end of the day it goes withe job. Makes no difference if Gillard was male or female, a deeply unpopular leader is going to cop a fair amount of flack. Howard received equal abuse if not worse on the back of his decision to enter Iraq in support of the US.  ",64,TimOfAltona
4514,"Keep it up pal, you have a looooong time to think about where Labor went so horribly wrong and what they can do about it in the years ahead. ",30,TimOfAltona
4515,Gillard was a product of the unions and was to a large extent controlled by them (and John McTernan) and in return they protected her and extended her term way beyond her use by date. ,36,TimOfAltona
4516,"Unfortunately for you, he has chosen not to back your team so all you can do is attack him - there is a term for that but it escapes me for the moment - but had he backed Labor your comments would be full of praise and admiration for him. ",51,TimOfAltona
4517,"Funny how the majority of Labor/Greens cheer squad dislike Murdoch for no other reason that he did not back THEIR team. Had Murdoch supported the ALP on Sept 07, these type of comments would be nowhere to be seen. ",40,TimOfAltona
4518,"Murdoch's comments make a lot of sense - if Australia is to grow as a nation and become a major player amongst world economies we need a substantially higher population base - increased population leads to increased demand for goods and services, creates jobs and delivers governments increased tax revenues to pay for the necessary infrastructure growth that comes with growing cities and towns. ",65,TimOfAltona
4519,"Murdoch is correct when he says Australia is in the box seat for embracing cultural diversity and the benefits, if managed correctly, that diversity delivers for a growing nation. ",30,TimOfAltona
4520,Sure they can have some input and control from the time the sheep board ships in Australia through to when they are up for sale in a market place outside Amman but they cannot oversee what happens when a family buys a sheep and takes it back to their house or other place to slaughter it. ,57,TimOfAltona
4521,"The period of time this story emerges from was when the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd Labor government was in power - Abbott had nothing to do with it as much as the cheer squad desperately try to link him to any negative story, on any subject that appears. ",46,TimOfAltona
4522,"If you think it through logically, Abbott is now defending what went down during the Labor years or does the cheer squad believe that Abbott as Opposition Leader was responsible for the actions of Australia's intelligence agencies? ",38,TimOfAltona
4523,You guys need to stop inflating the % of Murdoch owned print to suit your political leanings. How about you bring the 70% back to where it should be - you know what it really is so you don't need me to remind you.,44,TimOfAltona
4524,"What amuses me is that had Murdoch and News Ltd supported the ALP for the past few years, 95% of the Labor cheer squad in these threads would either be completely silent on the subject of media influencing public opinion or they would have been gushing of their support for Rupert Murdoch against any conservative lead criticism. ",58,TimOfAltona
4525,She withdrew her comments because the rabid Labor cheer squad were bullying and abusing her. She took it down for her own personal safety. Things can get pretty nasty when you get a bunch of hardline Labor supporters on your case. I should know.,44,TimOfAltona
4526,David the weakness in your argument is that there is no foundation at all to back up your assertions. Labor are on the nose in every state and Federally. Labor are soon to be thrown out in Tassie and SA which in my calculation leaves the ACT as the only state or Territory with a Labor government. ,58,TimOfAltona
4527,"Blindly copying and pasting ""One Term Tony"" on every comment you submit gets you nowhere - the reality is it is at least a 2 or 3 term Tony, largely because Labor are in such diabolical turmoil over leadership, over policy (Carbon Tax)over direction and over factional infighting. ",49,TimOfAltona
4528,"Yes Murdoch backed the Libs - but what many comments fail to mention is that Labor provided the media with plenty of ammunition to use - infighting, dysfunction, white-anting was rife. ",32,TimOfAltona
4529,Gillard and Rudd made serious errors of judgement during their times as PM - this gave the media many more negative stories to report. Unfortunately for Labor the negatives far outweighed the positives. ,34,TimOfAltona
4530,Labor supporters who solely blame the media on Labor's fall from grace are ignoring the very real problems the ALP made for themselves over the past 6 years and still have today.,32,TimOfAltona
4531,The inherent weakness in your argument is that both Federal and QLD governments are enjoying high approval ratings and the bookmakers have them both cruising home to victory at the next round of elections. ,35,TimOfAltona
4532,"If you're going down the private schools are bad and therefore should not be subsidised path then bullshit, without private schools the load and pressure on public schools would be a disaster for everyone. ",35,TimOfAltona
4533,"Take away the subsidies and hey presto the demand for public schools goes up 60% because parents can't afford to cover the subsidies the state and federal govt contribute, on top of the $22k-$30k annual fees they already pay per child.",41,TimOfAltona
4534,Thankfully we no longer have a government dictated or controlled by the unions (rife when Gillard was PM) and the Coalition will weigh up all options without digging our debt hole deeper. ,33,TimOfAltona
4535,What happened was both the Coalition and Labor were put up for examination by the Australian voting public and Labor were found to be sorely wanting and were thrown out by voters. The voters liked what they saw in the Coalition and everything stacked up and they were easily voted in - something like 90 seats to Labor's 55. ,60,TimOfAltona
4536,It was Labor's denial of the facts that saw it crushed at the last election and it seems that a small number of their supporters are still living in denial. ,31,TimOfAltona
4537,Couldn't help but observe that Labor have supported the audit commission and I also see that the remaining 3 state and Territory Labor leaders have welcomed the news that GST is also on the audit commissions agenda. ,38,TimOfAltona
4538,"The only fireworks we will be seeing over the next 3 years will be internal Labor fighting, dysfunction and leadership instability as the Rudd camp ramps up Kevin's return to the leadership. ",33,TimOfAltona
4539,"Speaking of polls, did you see the latest one that has PM Tony Abbott's popularity at an all time high? The same poll showed Labor's primary vote, since Electricity Bill took over, has dropped to it's lowest level since the darkest days of the failed Gillard government. ",48,TimOfAltona
4540,Seems the majority of Australians are very happy with the way the new PM and government are performing and also think Labor are still going backwards. Perhaps they are right.,30,TimOfAltona
4541,"Always good to see the government following through on policies it took to the election. The audit commission was a key Coalition policy and following a resounding election win, they are following through on their promises. ",37,TimOfAltona
4542,"It seems a small number of people on these threads may not have voted for the Coalition and are still coming to terms with the ALP's crushing defeat, however for the majority of us who voted for the Coalition it is comforting to know we at last have a competent government running the show and delivering on key promises.  ",61,TimOfAltona
4543,"What a load of crap you speak. Australian governments, Labor and Liberal have been spying on other countries since WWII. All the fuss going on right now relates to events during the Rudd Labor government - yet you open your comment with ""We have elected ourselves a spying government"". ",50,TimOfAltona
4544,You are spot on. The hapless Labor cheer squad have talked themselves into thinking and declaring this is all Tony Abbott and the Coalition's fault. This all happened during the Rudd/Gillard years. ,33,TimOfAltona
4545,Perhaps you should stick your hand up to be the PM's foreign policy advisor? Sounds like you have a much better grasp on the situation than the whole of the Foreign Affairs Dept combined - Tony Abbott is clearly missing out on your expertise on this issue..,47,TimOfAltona
4546,"Yeah I know, but it sh*ts me on the stupidity of some of the comments.Blame everything and anything that happens on Tony Abbott and hope something sticks whether it's true or not.",32,TimOfAltona
4547,You need to go back and check your facts - you seem to have got yourself all confused between Labor and Liberal governments - a fellow called Kevin Rudd was Australian PM at the time of the UN Climate Change conference in 2007 and if you go back and check wikipedia you'll notice almost immediately that Kevin Rudd was a Labor Prime Minister - strange but true. ,68,TimOfAltona
4548,"Funny how the 'mess' was created during the hapless Labor government years - yet another Labor debacle the Coalition have to repair, along with the economy, people smugglers and carbon tax. ",32,TimOfAltona
4549,Looks like David misses his daily dose of government inspired debacles we came to know so well when the hapless Labor government were in power......we all remember them so well......good to see a competent government getting on with the business of running the country without the daily stuff ups and dysfunction ala the ALP. ,55,TimOfAltona
4550,These people undertook an operation they a) knew was illegal under Russian law b) knew they stood a very real chance of being arrested and c) If arrested they would be charged with offences that would see them incarcerated in a Russian police station or gaol. ,47,TimOfAltona
4551,"So, they went ahead and did it anyway and surprise, surprise all a,b &amp; c above occurred and now they want their respective governments to get them out of the aforementioned Russian gaol and presumably flown home. ",38,TimOfAltona
4552,The Australian government can only do so much in foreign jurisdictions - I guess the solution to all this is don't do it in the first place - there are other ways to protest without offering yourself up for incarceration and then expecting your government to come to the rescue?,50,TimOfAltona
4553,I guess all the anti-LNP commentators in this thread who will oppose anything and everything a LNP government does have never had a shotgun blast to the face or been maimed in a chain attack or had bikie drug dealers supply your children with hard drugs that destroy their lives? ,51,TimOfAltona
4554,Going by your comments you support the bikies right to conduct their business and if they can still operate and get away with it under the existing laws then good luck to them.  ,35,TimOfAltona
4555,"Of course, it has nothing to do with the Greens holding a gun to Julia Gillard's head and telling her ""Carbon Tax or you will never be PM"" does it Marian?",31,TimOfAltona
4556,"Speaking of legislation, did you notice that the Coalition have 90 seats, yes that's NINETY seats vs the Labor/Greens coalition of 56 seats - I doubt any of the government's legislation will have any problem with numbers like that - do you? ",43,TimOfAltona
4557,From July 01 the Labor/Greens Senate coalition will lose their balance of power - couldn't happen to a nicer party - and hey presto! all the bills from the lower house go through the Senate like a hot knife through butter. ,42,TimOfAltona
4558,Speaking of polls - have you seen the recent ones that has PM Tony Abbott's popularity at an all time high since taking Liberal leadership as well as PM? ,30,TimOfAltona
4559,"Wow, if it wasn't for a very tiny handful of true Labor believers left like you, the ALP would be in an even worse state than they are now. ",30,TimOfAltona
4560,"In the meantime, a strong competent government is getting on with the business of running the country for all Australian's - unlike Labor when they were around - thankfully no longer.",31,TimOfAltona
4561,"Sorry to break the news to you pal, but Labor, along with the Greens are pretty irrelevant these days. Labor were wiped out in the Lower House and from July 01 the Labor/Greens senate cabal means jack shit. ",39,TimOfAltona
4562,Someone told me the other day that the Labor party is a franchisee of the ACTU. They could be right - just look at the 'background' of all the Labor senators - roughly 90% of them ex trade union hacks.,40,TimOfAltona
4563,You just refuted your statement to me below - Labor and Greens have been preferencing and doing deals with each other for donkey's - Gillard's Carbon Tax is a beauty.,30,TimOfAltona
4564,This is the REAL Labor in action folks - this is why we no longer have a Labor government in this country. This is why Labor are soon to be tossed out in Tasmania and South Australia as well leaving only the tiny ACT with a Labor govt. ,49,TimOfAltona
4565,These people undertook an operation they a) knew was illegal under Russian law b) knew they stood a very real chance of being arrested and c) If arrested they would be charged with offences that would see them incarcerated in a Russian police station or gaol. ,47,TimOfAltona
4566,"So, they went ahead and did it anyway and surprise, surprise all a,b &amp; c above occurred and now they want their respective governments to get them out of the aforementioned Russian gaol and presumably flown home. ",38,TimOfAltona
4567,What does Wilkie expect the Foreign Minister to do? Launch an SAS rescue mission to break him out of the Russian gaol perhaps? Offer herself as a hostage replacement so he can be set free? ,36,TimOfAltona
4568,Get a grip and get into the real world Andrew Wilkie. You know how these things work and you also know that there are hundreds of Australians' incarcerated in foreign gaols for all manner of crimes and offences and there is only so much a government can do to assist in foreign jurisdictions.,53,TimOfAltona
4569,"What is it about Labor/Greens supporters that they feel they have to resort to offensive and childish name calling when posting comments about the PM, any Minister or the Coalition government? ",32,TimOfAltona
4570,Perhaps it makes them feel better knowing as they do that the Labor/Greens coalition are out of office for 9 years or more in the lower house and lose their balance of power in the senate in July. ,39,TimOfAltona
4571,"It was all about a lousy state sitting member, Liberal, who resigned prematurely and forced a bi election that gave the seat back to the former ALP member with a huge swing. ",33,TimOfAltona
4572,"You won't because you will go to ground and pretend it didn't happen - just like all the other failures the disastrous (got it right this time, thanks) Labor have produced over the past 6 years.",36,TimOfAltona
4573,"As much as Labor supporters try to cling onto some romantic ideal from 150 years ago, I think you may find it has somewhat lost it's relevancy in the year 2013. ",32,TimOfAltona
4574,Clinging to the past will get Labor nowhere. The Coalition are doing a better job of looking after the aspirations and well being of the 'working man' than Labor - just look at the swings away from Labor to the Coalition in traditional Labor seats. ,46,TimOfAltona
4575,It's only a matter of time before you or one of the Labor/Greens cheer squad ask the question - When will Tony Abbott admit that he has personally caused the Typhoon Haiyan disaster?,33,TimOfAltona
4576,"We simply saw Labor for what it was - a bad government, revolving door leadership debacles, daily dysfunction and back stabbing, many failed policies ( 2 or 3 were successful however) and a party that had lost sight of what it stood for anymore, to the point it's grass roots base were migrating to the Coalition. ",57,TimOfAltona
4577,"You belittle the Australian voting public, they don't need the media to make up their mind for them - a bad government is a bad government and Labor were terrible - full stop.",33,TimOfAltona
4578,You would seem to prefer that Indonesia off load as many asylum seekers as they can and Australia should sit back and accept them without hesitation - a throw back to Kevin Rudd in 2007. ,36,TimOfAltona
4579,"You should send that to the propaganda department of the ACTU,they would love it! They may even pass it to their political arm, the ALP, for a sing a long at shadow cabinet meetings.",34,TimOfAltona
4580,The Labor cheer squad need to stop running down Australia's armed forces with baseless accusations for their own cheap political agenda - it really is not a good look and enhances people's negative opinions about them.,36,TimOfAltona
4581,"Gee, you must have slept through the last 6 years and a whole Federal election - had you not done so you would have seen a very unliked group of people, they were called The Australian Labor Government. Now there was a group SO unliked they got thrown out of office, lost dozens of seats and unlikely to be back in government for a generation or more. ",68,TimOfAltona
4582,"So the situation is thus - Australian vessels enter Indonesia's SAR zone, presumably at the request of Indonesian authorities, to rescue/pick up asylum seekers who may or may not have sabotaged their boat to force a rescue and then Indonesia tell us to take the people back to Australia - they won't accept them back at Indonesian ports. ",59,TimOfAltona
4583,Such is the sad and lonely lot of the Labor/Greens cheer squad desperate to find a way for their failed parties to worm their way back from political oblivion. ,30,TimOfAltona
4584,It seems Indonesia readily allow any muslims to enter their country without scrutiny - this is a huge factor in the asylum seeker migration to this part of the world.,30,TimOfAltona
4585,That utopia exists for you in the daily edition of the Pyongyang Post - no criticism of the government at all! Just what you craved when the failed Labor party were in power.,33,TimOfAltona
4586,I'd tell Natalegawa to bugger off and sort out his government's corruption that permits the people smugglers to operate with impunity on Indonesian soil and while he's at it - do something for the West Papuans who are disgracefully marginalised in their own country.,44,TimOfAltona
4587,"The Indonesian government is complicit in the people smuggling trade by a) allowing asylum seekers to flood into Indonesia through their airports unchallenged and without visas b) failing to tackle the widespread corruption within the police, military and local government officials who allow the people smuggling trade to flourish unhindered and c) for assigning the former RAN patrol boats we donated to Indonesia explicitly for dealing with anti-people smuggling operations, to the northern ports (last I looked not too many asylum boats were leaving from the north of the country). ",91,TimOfAltona
4588,Indonesia is failing to carry it's share of the heavy lifting and expecting Australia to do all the work and deal with the people smuggling problem with minimal assistance from Indonesian authorities. ,33,TimOfAltona
4589,"Australia have directed billions of dollars in 'aid' to Indonesia over the years, injected hundreds of millions of tourist dollars into Bali each year, have turned a blind eye to most of Indonesia's human rights indiscretions in West Papua and are currently considering a request from the Indonesia government to buy up large tracts of land in Northern Australia to grow their own cattle and ship them back to Indonesian markets.........and now we have Marty Natalegawa forbidding Australia to return asylum seekers rescued in Indonesian SAR zone to return to Australia because they are ""Australia's problem"" ",97,TimOfAltona
4590,"Australia should not kowtow to Indonesia on this or any other issue...and we have the right to protect our borders from people entering illegally, just like any other sovereign nation.",30,TimOfAltona
4591,Good to see the government going about the business of stopping the boats - despite the tiny group of Labor supporters in these threads who so desperately want the boats to keep coming - the Coalition are pushing ahead with the policy we elected them to deliver on. ,49,TimOfAltona
4592,Actually no - as much as Labor/Greens cheer squad want it to fail so badly - it's going along ok - boat arrivals have dramatically dropped and fewer people are drowning.,31,TimOfAltona
4593,"You should hop on one of the betting sites - you will make a killing if you back Labor and they get up - or don't you expect Labor to win, like the rest of us?",36,TimOfAltona
4594,"Clearly the Labor/Greens cheer squad believe Indonesia has every right and should be encouraged to flood Australia with asylum seekers just as ""Mr Popular"" Kevin Rudd did in 2007. ",30,TimOfAltona
4595,Good to see the government has done a significantly better job of stopping the evil people smuggling trade than the hapless and dysfunctional Labor party - who created the problem in the first place. ,35,TimOfAltona
4596,"Only 3 years until the next Colaition government is sworn in - most likely with an increased majority, I'm guessing 97 seats. The bookies certainly have the Coalition outright favourites - for very good reason.",35,TimOfAltona
4597,Cannot accept that Labor are gone for a generation in all states and territories so all they have left is to vilify the government on some kind of payback mission as retribution for their crushing defeat in the federal election. ,41,TimOfAltona
4598,"Don't tell me - not the ALP???????? The party that has been thrown out of every Federal and State jurisdiction and are also about to be tossed out of SA and Tas? Oh, THAT ALP. ",36,TimOfAltona
4599,There is no need for a minister to attend and Justin Lee is a highly experienced diplomat extremely capable of effectively representing Australia under the auspices of the Dept of Foreign Affairs. ,33,TimOfAltona

4601,Why bother? - very simple my good cheer squadder - because he does not want to legitimise the method by which they attempt to enter Australia to apply for asylum ie: dangerous boat journey.,34,TimOfAltona
4602,I often used to wonder that of Julia Gillard. I reckon 98% of anything she said in public was scripted for her by John McTernan - he used to email her his scripts for that day each morning and she would rehearse them on the way into the office.,49,TimOfAltona
4603,This comment confirms what I have been saying for a long time - the posters on here are all Labor/Greens cheer squad members - part of the Labor/Greens coalition. ,30,TimOfAltona
4604,"Another Labor supporter living in denial of the real world - have a look at the make up of the senate from July 01, do the math, and then come back and tell us what you have discovered. ",39,TimOfAltona
4605,Interesting choice by Shorten - he knows only too well that Abbott only wears blue ties - so it looks like he's trying to emulate Tony Abbott -Tony Abbott lite perhaps?,31,TimOfAltona
4606,Could one of the Labor/Greens cheer squad get a note to Bill Shorten that he only has 56 votes in the Lower House and the Government has 91 votes - so pretty much wasting everyones time and trying to play silly buggers with votes and cheap point scoring - pretty much a fail for Labor at every turn. ,59,TimOfAltona
4607,They don't want you to because they don't want to hear about any of that. They are happy blindly attacking for the sake of blindly attacking...it's called payback for Labor's defeat coupled with embarrassment at the ALP's implosion over the past few years and it's continuing decline in the Australian political landscape.,52,TimOfAltona
4608,Had Labor not squandered the nation's savings on some wild and reckless socialist spending spree then we would not be looking at an increase in debt ceiling at all. ,30,TimOfAltona
4609,Time for the Left to accept your Labor govt had a turn and stuffed it up - time for a competent govt to come in and sort out Labor's mess - once again. ,34,TimOfAltona
4610,"Go back in history and you'll see the same situation unfold - Labor spend all our money, rack up record debt and then a Coalition govt come in a fix it all up with prudent fiscal policies.",37,TimOfAltona
4611,"C'mon Labor/Greens cheer squadders , we all know that if Abbott had bailed out of CHOGM you would all be sprouting how he has embarrassed Australia in the eyes of the world for not attending and here is attending CHOGM so you still feign indignation to attack him for going. ",51,TimOfAltona
4612,It does get boring and makes you look the fools you are. You need to accept that the ALP were well and truly beaten in the last election and that no amount of confected accusations and childish name calling will magically make a Labor government reappear. According to our constitution you have to wait another 3 years before the ALP can lose another election. ,65,TimOfAltona
4613,If all you claim is true then Labor must be a shoe in for the next round of state and federal elections - let's see what the betting agencies who reflect public opinion say the odds are shall we - ,41,TimOfAltona
4614,South Australia - Liberals $1.15 Labor $5.50Tasmania - Liberals $1.15 Labor $6.00Northern Territory- Country Liberals $1.60 Labor $3.20Queensland - LNP $1.18 Labor $5.50Victoria - Liberals $1.51 Labor $2.30NSW - Liberals $1.09 Labor $7.50Next Federal Election - Coalition $1.20 Labor $4.50 ,41,TimOfAltona
4615,So keep shaking those pom poms and twirling those batons as hard as you can - nobody is listening or cares except within your own small bitter and twisted circle affectionally referred to as the Guardian Labor/Greens cheer squad - you all know who you are.,46,TimOfAltona
4616,"If you look very closely at the photo at the header of the article you can just make out the strings attached to Gillard, a bit like the old Thunderbirds puppets, and out of shot is John McTernan up in the rafters pulling the strings making her operate.  ",50,TimOfAltona
4617,"If you look really really closely you can actually see the ear piece that is feeding her the John McTernan script - just like when she was PM,everything that came out of her mouth in public was pre-scripted by John McTernan. ",42,TimOfAltona
4618,"The problem with all this incessant anti Tony Abbott rhetoric is that it is hollow and incredulous, Had Abbott apologised all the Labor/Greens grubby comment squad would be vilifying him for sucking up to Indonesia and when he refuses to apologise the grubby comment squad vilify him for insulting Indonesia. ",51,TimOfAltona
4619,"Yep, ol Tony ""Ski Lodge"" Burke is a fine example of future Labor leadership - perhaps he's looking forward to another free weekend with his family at Eddie Obeid's private chalet this winter, just like the others he's had in years gone by?",43,TimOfAltona
4620,I think it's time some of these people posting comments full of confected outrage and clearly false accusations need to take a deep breath and think before they post - it makes many of them appear unhinged.,37,TimOfAltona
4621,"Actually you will find that the Sri Lankan government do considerably more to prevent boats leaving the east coast of Sri Lanka heading for Australia. The Sri Lankan navy actually intercept, board and take the asylum seekers back to Sri Lankan ports. ",43,TimOfAltona
4622,When was the last time you heard the Indonesian government do that? It seems they have trouble locating the thousands of boats that have departed Java since Kevin Rudd and Labor rolled out the welcome mat.,36,TimOfAltona
4623,"Now that all the Commonwealth countries that practice the Westminster system are conservative ( yes that's right, Labor have been thrown out of government in all Westminster countries around the world) it's up to the conservative governments to lead the way in dealing with human rights abuses. A huge responsibility.",50,TimOfAltona
4624,Rudd does not need the government to give him a job - he has enough high level contacts around the globe to carve out a career - that said Abbott could do alot worse than consider Rudd for the UN Ambassador role.,42,TimOfAltona
4625,The US and Japan have likewise publicly commented on this surprise move by China. Bishop is not out on a limb here as much as the Labor/Greens cheer squad want it to appear so.,34,TimOfAltona
4626,Makes a lot of sense - Julie Bishop has the credentials to sort this out with Natalegawa. This is but a passing irritant and one that was caused by the Rudd/Gillard administrations and now being sorted out by the Coalition. ,41,TimOfAltona
4627,"I think you may be a bit confused over this issue - USA, Japan and Australia have all commented on China's surprise announcement. It is not only Australia. As much as you want it to be all about Australia, it isn't. ",42,TimOfAltona
4628,Shame on the Labor/Greens cheer squad for backing Indonesia over this matter instead of sticking up for their own country - afterall it was a Labor Government under the failed Rudd and Gillard that created this mess in the first place. ,42,TimOfAltona
4629,Surely QLD Labor don't need anymore bashing up - they were decimated last time around and yet you want to take a bat to them again next time around - sums up Labor right around Australia at the moment.,39,TimOfAltona
4630,That is a very weak and confected argument - trying to cover up Labor's inherent failures by blaming the media. This is exactly why Labor are out of office for years to come - deny that there is a problem within their own party.,44,TimOfAltona
4631,What a load of rubbish - time for you to accept that Labor were crushed at the election - you only need to look at all the empty seats on the opposition side of the chamber to demonstrate the shellacking Labor received - for very good reason.,47,TimOfAltona
4632,Give it a bit more time and you'll see what the rest of us do - an adult government doing a great job in stark contrast to the endemic failures of the hapless Labor party.,35,TimOfAltona
4633,"No - the message is mixed. Plibersek and Shorten need to get their stories aligned - perhaps a bit of good 'ol communication may assist them, or don't they talk anymore?",31,TimOfAltona
4634,This was always only 1 of a number of initiatives to stop people smuggling. Was probably never going to get up and does not matter - there are other initiatives tha are working. ,34,TimOfAltona
4635,This should pretty much be the end of the Alan Joyce experiment. Was never going to work bringing in a cut price budget airline guy to run a full service Qantas. ,32,TimOfAltona

4637,By the way - we (the majority of Australians) think the Coalition are doing a terrific job in working to clean up the mess following 6 years of Labor dysfunction and policy failures. ,34,TimOfAltona
4638,"At least it gives the regular cheer squad in these forums some temporary relief, however small, before their beloved Labor/Greens coalition are made totally irrelevant in both houses come July. ",31,TimOfAltona

4642,I think everyone needs to calm down and wait for the full facts. Most of the Labor/Greens cheer squad in these forums will only see and hear what they want to and then twist it around to suit their own purposes. We see this over and over again on a daily basis. ,53,TimOfAltona
4643,"The PM is not going down this path without due regard for outcomes - he knows the importance of education and associated funding. As with the NBN rollout, Labor fudged the facts and hid the true cost blowout in funding, leaving a billion dollar hole in education. ",48,TimOfAltona
4644,That's a load of nonsense. The Labor/Greens cheer squad have been having a field day vilifying Peta Credlin as they hold her partly responsible for Labor's crushing defeat. It's called pay back plain and simple. ,36,TimOfAltona
4645,Plibersek was slapped down a beauty on the last question answered by Dutton. Plibersek botched the roll out of the e-health initiaitive - except as it turns out in her own electorate. The look on her face was priceless - like a deer in the head lights before she went scurrying from the chamber.,54,TimOfAltona
4646,Fail - I was looking for the link that supports Warren Truss labeling Mandela a terrorist - or any member of the Abbott government for that matter. That was the assertion made.,32,TimOfAltona
4647,"If the ALP want the people of Australia to take them seriously as the alternative government, they need to start acting responsibly and not like primary school children who have drunk too much red cordial. ",36,TimOfAltona

4649,When a cast my eye across the Government's side of the house I see a swarth of female MP's - all of them with the opportunity to one day join their female colleagues on the front bench (or Speaker's chair).,40,TimOfAltona
4650,"Now come on, come clean, you know as well as I do that it matters not what the PM has on his Xmas card - you will look for a way to vilify him over it. ",37,TimOfAltona
4651,What a joke Albanese is with his high speed rail diversion. He knows there is zero funding for this - Labor are very adept at spending money they do not have - Comrade Gillard was a master of borrowing and spending. ,42,TimOfAltona
4652,All these Labor/Greens cheer squadders' predicting doom and gloom. I'd love to know who they think will win govt in 3 years time - The Greens?PUP perhaps? Sure as hell won't be the failed ALP.,35,TimOfAltona
4653,Give us a break - if he was not attending your whole comment would be scripted around how he is shaming Australia by not representing us at Mandela's memorial service. ,31,TimOfAltona
4654,Time for some of the Labor/Greens cheer squad to pull their head in and get used to the fact that there is a Coalition govt in power for many many years to come. ,34,TimOfAltona
4655,Now you just know that had Abbott NOT attended the entire Labor/Greens cheer squad would have been all over it like a rash - he does attend and you still try and raise a confected argument to criticise him for going. ,42,TimOfAltona
4656,"The Republic of SA have never even heard of Bill Shorten - as much as you fantasize that he may be a global super star, he actually isn't, in fact he'll never even be a PM - Labor will go through the usual leadership musical chairs until they come up with someone to be their next PM in perhaps 12 years or so. ",64,TimOfAltona
4657,I trust the comrades down at the ACTU are proud of themselves for slowly but surely making a huge contribution to the current predicament for Holden and car manufacturing in this country. ,33,TimOfAltona
4658,The problem with your comment is that had Abbott not been attending the funeral you would have been condemning him for not going - Abbott is going so you desperately try to concoct a negative comment about him for going. ,41,TimOfAltona
4659,I'm guessing there are quite a few Labor and Liberal voters who don't support the government pouring billions into propping up Holden for another few years until Holden once more come back asking for more and more money or they will leave Australia. ,44,TimOfAltona
4660,"The unions have been forcing wages up in this country for decades and now that we are uncompetitive, the unions want the government to step in and prop up the industry they pushed to the brink. ",37,TimOfAltona
4661,I can - along with the majority of other Australians. Pretty much just the Labor/Greens minority that keep sprouting anti-government sentiment that seem to have a problem with anything and everything.,31,TimOfAltona
4662,This will not be good news to the Labor/Greens cheer squad - they hate it when positive news about the Australian government is reported. They try their best to twist it around and post comments infused with the usual grubby vilification. ,42,TimOfAltona
4663,"You need to join the real world and understand the threat posed by the terrorist organisations operating in Afghanistan. Can you now explain how intervention in Afghanistan was disgraceful? - unless of course you support the Taliban's right to pratice Sharia law, execute women in public for being the victims of rape, deny females any form of education, hang young homosexual men from cranes in market places and the list goes on. ",73,TimOfAltona
4664,Even the Labor/Greens cheers squad acknowledge that Labor's infighting destroyed the party for years to come and that Labor don't deserve to be in government- yet all they do is vilify anything to do with the Coalition - I ask the Labor/Greens cheer squadders' - what is your proposed alternative if it ain't Labor or the Coalition? ,58,TimOfAltona
4665,It certainly isn't the ALP - you never read or hear the Labor cheer squad support the current Labor party - I'm guessing it's because they all still sit in either the Gillard or Rudd camp. ,37,TimOfAltona
4666,What a load of baloney this story is. So politicians spend public money going about their business. Big deal. All it does is fuel the Labor/Greens cheer squad who will only ever find fault in every cent that Tony Abbott spends as PM of this country and they will completely ignore/accept any spending done by Labor/Greens politicians. incl Julia Gillard. ,61,TimOfAltona
4667,McTernan was a goose and played a large part in Gillard's downfall. He manipulated her speeches and scripted her on virtually every public announcement she made and she allowed him to do it. They are equally culpable for the tearing apart of the ALP.,44,TimOfAltona
4668,I think in your abject determination to vilify anything and everything to do with the Australian government you and the other Labor/Greens cheer squad members have got yourselves a bit confused over this issue. ,35,TimOfAltona

4670,It would be useful in these forums if the Labor/Greens cheer squad actually understood some of the issues and the background before they blindly launch into their daily anti-government rhetoric.,30,TimOfAltona
4671,Don't be concerned - both Plibersek and Shorten are only keeping the chairs warm for the next Leader and Deputy - both will be gone by the time Labor are in a position to have another crack at government - maybe in 2022.,43,TimOfAltona
4672,"Come clean - you and just about every other regular contributor/reader in the Guardian threads know that you will find fault in anything and everything Abbott does or says. If no fault is there, you conjure up some nonsense - just like your comment above.",45,TimOfAltona
4673,To put some balance into the debate now lets hear from the doctors who report that we are doing a good job under extremely difficult circumstances in dealing with people arriving illegally by boat. ,35,TimOfAltona
4674,There will be doctors out there who will paint a very positive picture as to how we are dealing with this situation - any chance of hearing from them David?,30,TimOfAltona
4675,I'm not holding my breath waiting for the Labor/Greens cheer squad to actually admit that it was Labor in power and running the show when this letter was constructed. They conveniently look the other way and pretend that this is all to do with the Coalition.,46,TimOfAltona
4676,How do you view Rudd and Gillard then? Of course you will never respond to that question because you could never be seen to criticize the ALP who are equally culpable.,31,TimOfAltona
4677,I think you may have got yourself a little confused over this article - pretending that these practices did not occur while Labor were in government for 6 years and suggesting that this is all to do with the Coalition points to your total bias and irrelevancy to the debate.,50,TimOfAltona
4678,"To the contrary, good to see the government on top of things and following through on the promises they made before the election - the promises we voted them in to enact. ",33,TimOfAltona
4679,It takes some time to sort out the fiscal and policy mess left behind after 6 years of Labor mismanagement - the task is perhaps larger than we all envisaged - but the majority of Australians have great faith in this government to deliver. ,45,TimOfAltona
4680,"With a little less than 3 years to go before the next Coalition government is sworn in, it's good to see so many people with positive impressions of the Coalition leadership team. ",33,TimOfAltona

4682,Smart move by the PM. Good thing Labor have been thrown out and we have responsible economic management under the Coalition. They will eventually get on top of 6 years of massive Labor debt.,34,TimOfAltona

4684,"Not an unreasonable request at all. Most large companies in Australia have a code of conduct which new employees are required to acknowledge and sign as part of the recruitment process - covers workplace behaviour, company regulations etc etc. ",40,TimOfAltona
4685,Abbott to his credit has publicly stated that mankind is influencing climate change and that steps do need to be taken - it's the path we take that is in contention. ,32,TimOfAltona
4686,This issue has already brought down 2 or 3 Labor PM's in recent times (depending on your view) and one conservative LOTO - a tough challenge for any government - Labor or Liberal.,33,TimOfAltona
4687,"The Australian Labor cheer squad on here have no issue with Rupert Murdoch, they actually think he is an accomplished Australian (albeit he is also a US citizen), they admire his acumen and his success on the world stage. ",40,TimOfAltona
4688,The part they do not like is that Murdoch was not backing their team in the last Australian Federal Election - Murdoch chose to back the current Australian PM and the Labor cheer squad can't stand it. For them it's payback time so they expend all their energy in denigrating Murdoch at each and every opportunity. They like to apportion blame for Labor's dismal performance and dysfunctionality on News Ltd - a confected smokescreen to camouflage Labor's inherent inadequacies.  ,81,TimOfAltona
4689,"The irony is, that had Murdoch backed Rudd and the ALP, all these Labor cheer squad commentators would either be silent in threads relating to Murdoch or they would be praising and supporting him as a great Australian who is unfairly judged by others. ",45,TimOfAltona
4690,Newsflash! Many thousands of middle aged Australians have grown up children living and working in Europe - Thousands of these people enjoy visiting their children during the holiday break. No surprises there. ,33,TimOfAltona
4691,"Actually Pat, I think you'll find that the only 'outrage' generated is within a handful of Labor supporters in the Guardian thread. The submission itself is not nearly as bad as the Labor people would have you believe - there are safeguards proposed - these have been ignored by the commentators in this thread to suit their own political bias. ",61,TimOfAltona
4692,"Also, you mention 'no surprises' - well this GP submission is in keeping with that position - it is canvassing opinion ahead of any government action - it may or may not go ahead from here, but at any examination I fail to see how the government can be accused of putting up legislation without consultation - it is doing exactly what any elected government should be doing as it goes about the business of governing.",76,TimOfAltona
4693,How this GP report has any correlation with what you are asserting beats me. The comments emanating from the handful of Labor/Greens supporters are bordering on hysteria in the extreme. ,31,TimOfAltona
4694,"You guys are hopeless - this only a report, it is not govt policy, I doubt that Abbott would even be aware of it - yet you are all carrying on like Abbott authored it and it has been legislated. ",41,TimOfAltona
4695,Your hysteria over this is laughable. Have you even read the report or are you just going along with the lies and deception of a handful of Labor/Greens commentators on here.?,31,TimOfAltona
4696,"You have got yourself all muddled up - pensioners are not paying for it, nor are health card holders. It is only a paper for discussion at this stage. ",30,TimOfAltona
4697,"The only 'fears' are in the minds of Labor supporters such as yourself - the majority of people have no issue. There are plenty of protections for pensioners and health card people - it does not affect them and the $5 payment kicks in only after 12 visits to the doctor, and this is only a proposal. 'Chippendale' conveniently ignores all the facts of this matter as he usually does.",70,TimOfAltona
4698,All the Labor cheer squad are calling for this to be a one term Abbott government - yet not one of them are proposing who should replace the Abbott government.  ,32,TimOfAltona
4699,Can I suggest that once the carbon tax is removed there will be more than enough savings to offset any potential visit to a doctor - not wanting to demean your argument - but you will find that electricity bills will reduce which will be of great assistance to the very people you mention.,54,TimOfAltona
4700,Unfortunately for you and so many other of the Labor cheer squad you have completely misinterpreted what is going on - pensioners are exempt - so there's no point in carrying on about pensioners being hit hard. ,38,TimOfAltona
4701,Good to see the government taking additional steps to reverse Labor's tragic economic management....measures had to be taken and this suggestion/proposal is not a large impost and I see pensioners/health card holders are exempt anyway. ,36,TimOfAltona
4702,Peta Credlin has done an admirable job as the PM's Chief of Staff. Probably the most accomplished CoS for many years. Not sure why the Labor/Greens cheer squad fear her so much - perhaps it's because she was a key player in the removal of the former failed ALP government? ,51,TimOfAltona
4703,"Your Labor bias has you all confused over this issue - it was the Ambassador who went to the media to broadcast her intentions hoping it would assist her case - Morrison is merely responding, as would any other Immigration Minister.  ",43,TimOfAltona
4704,"All Morrison is doing here is expressing what any Immigration Minister would be doing under these circumstances, yet the usual grubby comments emerge from a handful of people who are yet to concede that the hapless ALP were beaten by a better side last election. ",46,TimOfAltona
4705,I think we all agree that the Immigration Minister portfolio is one of the toughest around - just look at how many successive Immigration Minster's there were in the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years. ,32,TimOfAltona
4706,Morrison is doing a good job under difficult circumstances - when you peel back the white noise emanating from the Labor/Greens cheer squad in the Guardian threads - the Coalition are actually reducing the number of boat arrivals and consequently the deaths at sea. ,45,TimOfAltona
4707,Morrison should be congratulated and is congratulated for his efforts in combating people smugglers - this is why the people of Australia flicked a dysfunctional and incompetent Labor government and installed a Coalition government to fix the problem - and don't the Labor cheer squad hate his success!!,48,TimOfAltona
4708,"The Labor/Greens cheer squad commenting on this need to come clean - it matters not which decision Scott Morrison makes on this issue, they will conjure up some grubby comments condemning the outcome - either way. ",37,TimOfAltona
4709,"Youare wrong and you clearly missed the Fact Check on this issue - don't worry, the rest of the Labor/Greens cheer squad did too - so to assist you I will post the link to the Fact Checker piece which concludes that Morrison is correct in his terminology - here is the conclusion cut and paste - ",58,TimOfAltona
4710,"The verdict 
Mr Morrison is correct. 
Based on the definition set out in the people smuggling protocol, people who have come to Australia without a valid visa have illegally entered the country. 
That is the case even though these people have not committed any crime, nor broken any Australian or international law. ",53,TimOfAltona
4711,Exactly. The Labor/Greens cheer squad see it very differently - their strong preference is for the boats to keep arriving - it allows them to continue their vilification of the government.,31,TimOfAltona
4712,Funny how so many of the comments on here are actually supporting the activities of people smugglers - the Labor/Greens cheer squad are actually barracking for the people smugglers to keep the boats coming - they dread the thought that the Coalition may actually be successful in reducing the numbers of boat arrivals - such an outcome would make the Coalition look good and confirm what we all knew about Labor's incompetence. ,73,TimOfAltona
4713,Good on Morrison for doing exactly what we voted this government in to do - stopping the boats and the associated deaths and misery that accompanies the people smugglers vile trade. ,32,TimOfAltona
4714,Don't the Labor/Greens cheer squad just hate it when the boats stop arriving - they just hate it - they want as many boats as possible to keep arriving - makes them feel all good inside to think that the Coalition may be as terrible as Labor were in stopping the boats. ,53,TimOfAltona
4715,"Labor cheer squad will insist that they are not in a coalition with the Greens so we subtract The Greens vote and we end up with Labor at 4,311,398 votes vs the Coalition at 5,882,904. ",36,TimOfAltona
4716,"Just because you don't like Abbott and could never bring yourself to acknowledge some of the good work he is doing, there is no need to attack Mundine's integrity and intelligence.",31,TimOfAltona
4717,"It's not Albo's fault - it's just that the ALP don't know what they stand for any more, all they can do is oppose for the sake of opposing. It's a great smokescreen to hide their inherent inadequacies. ",39,TimOfAltona
4718,This guy deliberately broke Russian law and knew the consequences would be imprisonment - yet he expects the Aussie government to bail him out of trouble when he did in fact get arrested. ,34,TimOfAltona
4719,Can't wait for the betting agencies to open up the Griffith by-election. All the Labor/Greens cheer squad are pontificating on how Glasson will be beaten by Labor hands down. ,30,TimOfAltona
4720,Toxic Labor are so on the nose in QLD (and elsewhere) - you only have to look at the odds for an LNP victory in the next QLD state election - LNP $1.20 Labor $3.90. ,36,TimOfAltona
4721,You didn't answer my question - in fact you completed averted your answer away from who will be the Labor leader to end Tony Abbott's government at the next election. ,31,TimOfAltona
4722,"Pal, you know as well as every other reader on here that this government has been in power for 5 minutes vs the 6 long years we endured the failed Labor experiment. ",33,TimOfAltona

4724,"No doubt the NZ Labour Party and Council of Trade Unions will disagree, but I suspect John Key will go down in the history books as being one of NZ's great reforming PMs. ",34,TimOfAltona
4725,Here's a tip - a handful of vengeful comments will not return the ALP to government any time soon - the Coalition are in government for the many years ahead. ,31,TimOfAltona
4726,Get used to the idea and perhaps if you start supporting the government's initiatives instead of trying to blindly tear everything down you may start feeling a bit better about yourselves. ,32,TimOfAltona
4727,The Labor cheer squad are very busy posting vengeful comments aimed at the PM and the government - funny thing is not one of them are proposing which politician or for that matter which party are best equipped to replace Abbott when he eventually steps down. ,47,TimOfAltona
4728,C'mon fellas - where is your unswerving support for that underwhelming and almost anonymous duo of Shorten and Plibersek? Oh that's right - there isn't any because you all know those two lightweights could never win an election for the ALP. ,42,TimOfAltona
4729,Also good news on the Tasmanian employment initiative and his initiative to tighten up taxpayer funded entitlements for parliamentarians - the latter should be welcomed by all sides of politics. ,31,TimOfAltona
4730,Well knock me over with a feather - a Greens spokesperson with hollow accusations is critical of the government ....why does the Guardian even report this stuff - must be an extremely slow news day.,35,TimOfAltona
4731,"David , I wish I had a dollar for every person who has written that Abbott won't last in the role, won't make it to the end of the year, won't make it to the election etc etc - yet not one person has proposed a) who would replace him if in fact he did go and b) who will be the leader of the ALP when we do eventually go to the polls in 2016/17? ",77,TimOfAltona
4732,The government's key objective is to make using people smugglers' boats as a means to get to Australia as unattractive as possible - disrupt their business model so people stop paying them for a service they can't possibly deliver. ,40,TimOfAltona
4733,"A number of tactics need to be deployed to achieve this disruption - turning boats around where it is safe to do so is one of a myriad of tactics, along with stopping the flow of information back to the people smugglers. ",43,TimOfAltona
4734,Morrison needs to be given some clear air to implement and apply the tactics - he is having some success thus far and certainly the frequency of departures and number of drownings have significantly reduced as a result. ,39,TimOfAltona
4735,"l, you are a bit confused over this - they have been successful in both dramatically reducing the volume of boast arrivals and have been busy delivering on their pre-election tactic of turning boats around where it is safe to do so. ",43,TimOfAltona
4736,I know it pains Labor supporters to see how an effective government works but get used to it - a little less than 3 years to go before the next Coalition government are sworn in!,35,TimOfAltona
4737,I have a suggestion for all the Labor/Greens cheer squad on here who so desperately want to see the boats keep departing Indonesia - why not actually support the government's actions in trying to prevent people getting on dangerous and leaky boats and attempting to reach Australia? ,48,TimOfAltona
4738,Is this not preferable to blindly attacking the government for trying to 'stop the boats' - people actually think you are in favor of people coming to Australia via boats from Indonesia and that you support the people smuggling activity.  ,42,TimOfAltona
4739,'Stop the boats' was a central plank of the Coalition's election promises - one that saw Labor lose government - therefore it's up to the cheer squad to attack any government initiative that actually delivers on that promise - they want it to fail so they can claim a 'victory' over the party that threw them out of government. ,60,TimOfAltona
4740,If asylum seekers want to post on a Guardian thread nothing is stopping them. I'm guessing your real name is not Brisco Rant (but I could be mistaken) so there is nothing to stop someone posting under a nom de plume as 99% of contributors do. ,47,TimOfAltona

4742,"Looking at many of the comments below, one would be excused for thinking that the Labor supporters here are very keen to see the boats arriving on our shores - the more the better. ",35,TimOfAltona
4743,They want the government's border protection policies to fail - the people to keep flooding in and the odd drowning or two along the way wouldn't do any harm either. ,31,TimOfAltona
4744,"So, I take it you are in favour of an open borders policy? Just let anyone everyone who wants to come to Australia by any means possible free passage into the country? ",33,TimOfAltona
4745,There are tens of millions of displaced persons around the globe - you want them all to come to Australia if they can find a way to come here with no restrictions whatsoever?,33,TimOfAltona
4746,By my reckoning we have roughly another 3 years to go before the next Coalition government is sworn in. The odds of Abbott entering the 2nd term as PM are very good. The betting agencies certainly have him as outright favourite.,41,TimOfAltona
4747,Quite a story. Surprised you can keep a sense of humor after an experience like that. Sounds like it all worked out in the end and your story graphically highlights the importance of recognizing the warning signs early on and acting on it - though no one would wish your experience on anyone.,53,TimOfAltona
4748,You may be right - the Labor/Greens coalition will probably see the seat retained by the ALP - makes no difference to anything at all apart from giving the Labor/Greens cheer squad some forlorn hope that the ALP may be back in federal government in 9 years or so.,49,TimOfAltona
4749,"Glasson will make a fine member for Griffith and best of all, there will be another vacant green seat on the Labor side of the house, - looks a bit lonely and desolate over that side of the house for hapless Labor. ",43,TimOfAltona

4757,"Tony Abbott made border protection a central plank in his election campaign late last year - it was a very big issue and the problem had been compounded when the previous Labor PM and government relaxed the immigration laws which saw tens of thousands of people making their way to Australia by leaky boats courtesy of people smugglers and corrupt Indonesian officials, resulting in 1000+ drownings at sea and billions of dollars of extra cost to the Australian tax payer. ",81,TimOfAltona
4758,"Ever since the conservatives have been in government, the Labour supporters have been attacking every move the government has made to prevent boats departing Indonesia. The Labor supporters desperately want the government's policy to fail as a direct payback for Labor's election loss. ",44,TimOfAltona
4759,"Crazy at may seem, many of them are very happy to see more and more boat loads of people arrive so they support the people smugglers' activities and denounce government measures to stop them. ",35,TimOfAltona
4760,It seems to provide them with some kind of twisted satisfaction so they can claim that the conservatives won government on a lie by being unable to stop the boats. ,31,TimOfAltona
4761,Make no mistake - the majority of Australian's are supportive of what the government are doing to prevent boats leaving Indonesia and therefore drownings at sea - the handful of disaffected Labor supporters who flock to the Guardian threads to attack the government for simply following through on what they promised to do before the election are in the minority and are pretty much irrelevant in the bigger picture. ,70,TimOfAltona
4762,Their biggest fear is that the conservative government will be successful with it's intention to 'stop the boats' and will go on to have another decisive victory in the 2016 election.,31,TimOfAltona
4763,I see your point re IAG - the QF/BA association goes back a long way - however I doubt if IAG would have the financial backing to take a majority shareholding in QF - the middle eastern airlines have the deepest pockets by far - with Emirates and Etihad at the top of the tree. ,56,TimOfAltona
4764,This sorry tale all goes back to a Qantas Board decision to replace Qantas CEO Geoff Dixon with the European budget airline Alan Joyce and overlook John Borghetti who received neither a fair hearing of even a proper interview for the role and promptly exited the airline. ,48,TimOfAltona
4765,"Joyce had a fixation on building up low cost Jetstar to the detriment of full service Qantas and after years of mis-management, poor decisions and IR debacles, Qantas is now a shadow of its former self and the whole house of cards is in danger of collapsing. ",48,TimOfAltona
4766,Meanwhile Borghetti has gone on and turned Virgin around to be a strong contender for the preferred airline for corporate Australia (the highest yielding fares) and is killing Qantas on some domestic routes - acquisition of Tiger Australia will also assist Virgin inflict further damage on Qantas/Jetstar. ,48,TimOfAltona
4767,Add to that a nice bit of joint marketing/partnership/codeshare with Borghetti's mate James Hogan from Etihad and suddenly Virgin have a very effective international network to exploit for both corporate and leisure travel.  ,35,TimOfAltona
4768,"The blame for this debacle sits with the QF Board and they should be the ones wearing the fallout over this, along with Joyce who simply cannot survive given the results and the turmoil at QF since he's been in the chair. ",43,TimOfAltona
4769,"Probably deferred. There is enough pressure on business with other taxes,penalties and on costs to contend with, particularly for small business.

I add that a % of these 'asylum' seekers are no doubt economic migrants trying to improve their wealth by coming to Australia with no real threat back home whatsoever. ",93,TimOfAltona
4775,"The Abbott government, just like the Labor government before, are trying to shut down the people smugglers operation by making it as unattractive as possible to board an illegal boat in Indonesia and attempting the journey to Australia.

4792,However a sovereign country has a right to protect it's borders from uncontrolled immigration - uncontrolled immigration provides the people smugglers with a huge incentive to expand their operation which will lead to tens of thousands more people turning up on our shores outside the UNHCR process and in turn perhaps hundreds or thousands of more drownings at sea. ,60,TimOfAltona

4809,The same people who told us about shots being fired are also telling us about an unseaworthy boat...you gotta stop being sucked in by propaganda designed to benefit the people smugglers operation.,32,TimOfAltona
4810,A pissed off asylum seeker who was returned to Indonesia after paying a people smuggler thousands of dollars and an Indonesian policeman who gets paid to wave the asylum seeker boats off from his shore are definitely telling us the truth.,41,TimOfAltona
4811,"Wow, how quickly the Labor/Greens supporters were sucked in by a lying asylum seeker who didn't make it to Australia in cohorts with an Indonesian policeman who most likely profits from the boats leaving his area. ",37,TimOfAltona
4812,You shouldn't allow yourself to be sucked in so quickly by lying asylum seekers who didn't make it to Australia and Indonesian policemen who profit from the boats departing. ,30,TimOfAltona
4813,Why would Morrison deny that it happened if it did - how many witnesses from the RAN and the people smugglers boat would there have been as well as video from the RAN of the incident? ,37,TimOfAltona
4814,"So here we have an anonymous disaffected asylum seeker telling an anonymous Indonesian police 'chief' that a certain event took place and hey presto the left swarm all over it in full support of the anonymous asylum seeker's story because it gives them ammunition, no matter how dubious, to attack the government. ",53,TimOfAltona
4815,"The message to people smugglers is clear - the Australian border is CLOSED to the smuggling of men, women and children via leaky boats - they will be stopped and turned around - it's not the ALP you are dealing with anymore.",42,TimOfAltona
4816,"Hey Santos, I just gave you a recommend - you deserve it for all the trouble you went to in responding to me, totally superfluous to what I was saying, but well done for a fine effort anyway.",38,TimOfAltona
4817,Well of course Tim Flannery is going to say that and of course the Greens will jump in along side him and of course the Labor supporters will jump in behind the Greens as they tend to do. ,39,TimOfAltona
4818,"Now let's hear from the experts who will tell us that Australia has been experiencing wide ranging climatic variations for millions of years and that man, whilst making a modest contribution to changing weather patterns which rightly should be addressed, are no where near as culpable as many alarmists make out.  ",53,TimOfAltona
4819,It could be another 200 years before Victoria experiences another 'record' hot spell - after all the last one was over 100 years ago and hotter than this current one.,30,TimOfAltona
4820,"The over riding challenge for both Labor and the Coalition has always been how to overcome the widespread corruption in Indonesia that allows the people smuggling trade to flourish - numerous police, military and government officials are all caught up in it and profiteering from the people smuggling operations. ",50,TimOfAltona
4821,Occasionally the SBY government arrest one or two officials and charge them with corruption relating to people smugglers but this is only window dressing to make it appear they are on top of it. ,35,TimOfAltona
4822,He won't be taking the grubby comments and childish name calling from the Labor/Greens people personally because any Coalition Minister with that portfolio will be copping personal attacks from the Labor/Greens pom pom shakers.  ,36,TimOfAltona
4823,Funny how all these people were non-critical when Labor introduced severe border protection measures when the McTernan/Gillard government panicked on the back of public opinion and later by Rudd when he went further than the Coalition in order to stave off electoral annihilation?,43,TimOfAltona
4824,"When people obviously from the left post disingenuous comments like ""I'm a swinging voter but could never bring myself to support Abbott"" the bullshit barometer goes right off the richter scale. ",32,TimOfAltona
4825,so...I take it then that you support the activities of the people smugglers and you think the government should leave them alone and allow boats to freely depart Indonesia and try and make it to Australia. ,37,TimOfAltona
4826,"If you do then perhaps you sit with the Greens, but if you don't then you should be supportive of what this government ( and the Labor government before) were doing to deter boat departures from Indonesia. ",38,TimOfAltona
4827,"Unfortunately while the majority of Australian voters will be applauding the government efforts and achievements in this area, a number of bitter and twisted Labor supporters will be desperately hoping and praying the boats start up again.",37,TimOfAltona
4828,The Labor/Greens cheer squad swarm all over anything to do with weather or asylum seeker boats because they see those two issues as key reasons to their thrashing last Sept.  ,32,TimOfAltona
4829,Melbourne has had hot spells like this going back thousands of years - the last one like this was 100 years ago and the next one will probably be in another 100 years. Blaming a government that has been government for a matter of weeks reflects on your utter stupidity.,50,TimOfAltona
4830,"Yes boys and girls with any luck the boats will start up again after that and we can all jump and down with glee, clap our hands and claim the government are lying. ",34,TimOfAltona
4831,It was very interesting when articles about Australia's asylum seeker problem and the Australian government response finds it's way onto front page overseas editions of the Guardian and comments are opened up. ,33,TimOfAltona
4832,"Reality is though that the government's initiatives are cutting through, the boats are slowing or even stopping and the majority of Australians can see that this government is delivering on a core election promise. ",35,TimOfAltona
4833,"Patrick, you completely left out the bit where the Rudd/Gillard government was tapping into the phones of SBY and his wifeyou could only muster enough strength to attack Howard and Abbott goats. ",33,TimOfAltona
4834,The bugging of his wife's phone was nothing to do with Tony Abbott - if you recall these accusations stem back to when Labor were in govt - you make it sound as if Abbott ordered the phone tapping. ,40,TimOfAltona
4835,I love how Abbott is cranking up the anger from the Labor/Greens pompom waivers by not publicly commenting on this - they so desperately want him to make some statements so they can shoot him down in flames irrespective of what he says - the fact he is saying nothing and is a small target is driving them nuts - smart move by Abbott. ,65,TimOfAltona
4836,"So while the Labor/Greens frilly skirt squad all rally in behind the Indonesian government , the Abbott government is quietly getting on with the job we elected them to do - stopping the boats. ",35,TimOfAltona
4837,Sprouting left wing scare mongering to try and land cheap blows on the government won't cut through to the majority of Australian voters who support what this government is doing in dealing with people smugglers and Indonesia.,37,TimOfAltona
4838,"To be fair you are correct, we don't yet know the extent of dysfunction in the latest ALP team - certainly dysfunction was the hallmark of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years and yes, the ALP did achieve some good outcomes over the 6 years despite the dysfunction and minority status.",48,TimOfAltona
4839,"Only problem is that this particular 'hired staff' was the puppet master of a sitting PM - ever since the ALP brought him out from UK Labor to 'improve' Gillard's image and polling, he scripted her day in day out and she went along with it - until it actually destroyed her political career (&amp; the Labor party)",58,TimOfAltona
4840,I think it's great the government are sending a strong message to both the people smugglers and the Indonesian government that Australia will not allow it's borders to be breeched by people smuggling activity. ,35,TimOfAltona
4841,Perhaps it's time Indonesia started to carry some of the responsibility for allowing people smugglers to operate do freely within their borders instead of leaving all the heavy lifting up to the Australian Government.,34,TimOfAltona
4842,"Fair assessment, this was never going to be solved in a matter of weeks- adding to the equation is the Indonesian elections - that will impact on any progress for a while as well. ",35,TimOfAltona
4843,My recommendation to you is you need to accept that Labor lost the last election by a country mile and it will be many years before whoever will be the leader of the ALP then will be PM - 9 or more at least. ,45,TimOfAltona
4844,Brilliant comment - Indonesia needs to start taking on some of the heavy lifting here instead of allowing corrupt officials to wave the boats off as they depart Indonesian ports.,30,TimOfAltona
4845,I think it's great the government are sending a strong message to both the people smugglers and the Indonesian government that Australia will not allow it's borders to be breeched by people smuggling activity. ,35,TimOfAltona
4846,Perhaps it's time Indonesia started to carry some of the responsibility for allowing people smugglers to operate so freely within their borders instead of leaving all the heavy lifting up to the Australian Government.,34,TimOfAltona
4847,They only ended up with tens of thousands arriving on our shores via people smuggling activity and adding billions of dollars of cost to the Australian tax payer. Yes they definitely need to be back in control once again.,39,TimOfAltona
4848,"C'mon David, you and I both know the answer to this - if he appears on TV to make a statement you and your comrades attack like junk yard dogs every word he utters and if he does not appear on TV you attack him for not fronting up and making a statement. ",54,TimOfAltona
4849,Don't dismiss McTernan as a mere 'staffer'. You and I both know he was scripting Gillard's speeches and responses to anything and everything - hell he was the architect of her misogyny speech - pretty much every wrote word for her. ,42,TimOfAltona
4850,"Be careful, all you lefties were quickly sucked in by the shots fired and now you just as quickly get sucked in by spurious allegations by a Somali refugeeno wonder you guys are in a minority grouping when it comes to public opinion over this matter. ",47,TimOfAltona
4851,"Also, thanks for reminding us once more about David Marr's book - it must be around 20 separate occasions you've pushed his book over the past 2 days - spam filter may need to be engaged.",36,TimOfAltona
4852,Funny how 18 year old Somali refugee making untested perhaps spurious allegations have an instant friend in the Labor/Greens cheer squad who embrace him as a lifelong member of the ALP.,31,TimOfAltona
4853,Shorten will never be a Labor PM and I think most of them see that - once Shorten has gone who will replace? Is Kev looking for another comeback perhaps?,30,TimOfAltona
4854,As the success of the operation becomes apparent they have nothing left in the locker but grubby comments and childish name calling - yep that'll get Labor back in office for sure. ,33,TimOfAltona
4855,It seems the only people concerned over this matter are the Labor/Greens commentators in this threadthe left seem to have taken it very personally indeed that Australia had the temerity to enter their good friend Indonesia's territorial waters. ,39,TimOfAltona
4856,Funny thing is most of your fellow countrymen and women back in the UK give this government a resounding thumbs up for their actions in stopping people smuggler operations. ,30,TimOfAltona
4857,You need to have think about what it mean to have hundreds of people smuggling boats hitting our shores each week because you want to see the government measures fail.,30,TimOfAltona
4858,3 long years to go pal by which time all the Coalition's pre-election commitments will be fulfilled and Labor will be left like a shag on a rock with no where to go.,33,TimOfAltona
4859,"Natasha, it's all confected anger - they actually don't give a toss whether our boats went into Indonesian waters or not - it gives them a nice little platform to try and land blows against the government. ",38,TimOfAltona
4860,When the navy became aware they had inadvertently entered Indonesian waters they reported that fact to Morrison who went on to advise the Indonesian government of the error and apologise. ,31,TimOfAltona
4861,"There is nothing to support your assertions about Operation Sovereign Borders what so ever, in fact it has been a successful operation as evidenced by the drop in boat arrivals. ",31,TimOfAltona
4862,"Swan was a goose, Gillard was economically naiive and in the greatest of Labor traditions Rudd just spent, spent, spent and kept on spending when there was no money left in the bank.",33,TimOfAltona
4863,The government should not and will not cave into blackmail from asylum seekers who jumped the UNHCR queue and now want to be processed ahead of others courtesy of media stunts. ,32,TimOfAltona
4864,This tactic is usually started by some advocate on the outside who talks them into using this tactic as a way to get media attention - which is just what has happened. ,33,TimOfAltona
4865,Their first mistake is that they are now dealing with a Coalition government - no longer the hapless Labor government that encouraged them to come here by boat in the first place.,32,TimOfAltona
4866,"Not sure what it is the Greens sing - so suggest if any of you 3 are from the Greens you too can sing 'Solidarity Forever' in support of your coalition partner, the ALP. ",35,TimOfAltona
4867,Not sure why the Guardian needs to make a headline story re Abbott's baddies vs baddies comment other than to pander to the regular cabal of left wing nut jobs posting on here. ,34,TimOfAltona
4868,"Thanks Helen for your input, but I would prefer to hear the definition proposed by the author of the comment - something tells me though it will not be forthcoming.",30,TimOfAltona
4869,The new government can only get away with blaming all our economic woes on the previous government for so long before they have to make their own mark by delivering on credible initiatives particularly for those at the poorer end of the socio-economic scale. ,45,TimOfAltona
4870,Old age pensions and new start allowances almost certainly need to increase and I think the new govt get this - how we pay for this reform is the challenge. ,31,TimOfAltona
4871,"LOL, won't need to with only 3 people turning up for a march...at least there are 2 of them to hold the banner...perhaps the 3 person turning up can belt out a few lines of ""Solidarity Forever""",37,TimOfAltona
4872,"Fair to say both sides have been feeling their way to some extent - the newly installed Abbott government coming to terms with actually being in government after 6 years in opposition and Labor, with a new look leadership team trying to rebuild after 6 years of bruising and destructive internal factional &amp; leadership battles plus the inherent challenges emanating from a hung parliament. ",65,TimOfAltona
4873,"Both sides still have their 'P' plates on and mistakes will inevitably occur and to be fair to Tony Abbott, since becoming PM he has been true to his word going about fulfilling his core campaign promises albeit without the level of transparency expected by some journalists and seemingly demanded by Labor and Greens supporters. ",56,TimOfAltona
4874,"The government are certainly yet to prove themselves and they would be aware that, apart from the opposition supporters who had already made up their minds by 10 pm on September 7, there are millions of voters who are expecting this government to deliver on a broad spectrum of positive economic, social, industrial, educational and environmental change. They will need to be seen achieving some of this over the next 3 years to ensure a second term in office.  ",81,TimOfAltona
4875,"With 90 seats in the lower house, the Coalition should be in the box seat to drive a return to the reforming centre - although with senate voting intentions from July still largely unresolved (PUP wildcard) Labor and The Greens may yet have the ability to poke a stick in the government's eye just because they can and the bitterness has the potential to endure.",65,TimOfAltona
4876,Nothing like a bit of good ol left wing denial to keep Labor out of office for the next decade - I thought Labor supporters would have learnt their lesson after the Gillard experiment.,34,TimOfAltona
4877,In light of the new allegations re trade union corruption in the Victorian building industry perhaps it's time to amend a well known ditty they all sing along to at ALP/trade union conferences ,34,TimOfAltona
4878,"Right here is why Labor will be in opposition for the next decade or so - close your eyes, block your ears and pretend everything is ok in camp Labor. ",31,TimOfAltona
4879,"When you are caught out big time, as with the Victorian building industry, all you want to do is blame the government and the media for Labor's obvious failings. ",30,TimOfAltona
4880,"Speaking of Victoria - I wonder how the political arm of the Trade Union movement, aka the ALP lead this month by Shorten, will handle the fall out from yet another corruption scandal involving unions in Victoria - this time the building industry. ",44,TimOfAltona
4881,"Something here does not add up - if conservative governments are so evil and people are sick and tired of conservative governments retrenching thousands of workers, closing down industries and training facilities and looking after the rich, then why are the Labor governments in Tas and SA about to be thrown out and conservative governments installed in the forthcoming state election? ",62,TimOfAltona
4882,"Oh yes, a 15 year old report by 2 left wing 'academics' from Melb Uni - must be true then and on that basis alone the government should immediately abandon all plans to further evaluate the merits or otherwise of the scheme. ",43,TimOfAltona
4883,The Labor cheer squad tried this one on in the lead up to the election - seemingly forgetting that their poster girl Julia Eileen Gillard was born in Wales. ,30,TimOfAltona
4884,They desperately attempt to shoot the prospect of work for the dole down in flames as they do with every other policy the government went to the election with. ,30,TimOfAltona
4885,The greatest fear for the Labor/Greens cheer squad is that the government might actually successfully deliver on their pre-election policies and go on to win by even more seats in 2016. ,32,TimOfAltona
4886,"If Gillard was held in SO high regard, why is it that it was her own party that chopped her off at the knees and disposed of her like she was some kind of wooden puppet consigned to the scrap heap (before the Australian voters got to do the honors)? ",51,TimOfAltona
4887,The Labor/Greens/Indonesian cheer squad always look the other way and go all silent when you mention Labor's disgraceful impost on this country - not to mention the 1000+ lives lost at sea.,32,TimOfAltona
4888,With the Indonesian elections bearing down there will be plenty of confected sabre rattling going on amongst the candidates and their aligned media outlets over who is seen to standing up to Australia the hardest. ,36,TimOfAltona
4889,"Despite the best efforts of the Labor supporters to stir Indonesia up over this, Indonesia will soon back down, go back into their box and the same ol same ol corruption will continue.",33,TimOfAltona
4890,"Yes, I agree, that we should support Indonesia when they have the guts to stand up to Australia, it makes it a whole lot easier for them to continue to avoid scrutiny over the killings and human rights abuses in West Papua and the murdering militia gangs they sponsored in East Timor not to mention turning a blind eye to the corruption amongst their military and police that allows the people smugglers to operate so freely in their ports. ",80,TimOfAltona
4891,You will all feel a great sense of pride when the PM addresses the forum at Davos later today - suggest everyone here tune in and witness how much Abbott's stature has grown in the eyes of the world. ,40,TimOfAltona
4892,So in other words - if Labor win any of the forthcoming elections/by-elections it is due to national politics but if Labor lose any of the forthcoming elections/by-elections it is due to local/state issues? ,35,TimOfAltona
4893,"The obvious weakness in your hypothesis is that in the unlikely event Labor actually retain govt in SA or TAS, all the Labor/Greens cheer squad will be screaming from the roof tops that it was because the Abbott government is unpopular. ",42,TimOfAltona
4894,Take no notice - most of these Labor/Greens cheer squadders would still attack/criticise the governments choice irrespective of who is chosen for the role - Abbott could have put Julia Gillard up for it and they would still be attacking him for his choice. ,45,TimOfAltona
4895,With Shorten leading the ALP (this month at least) his close union ties will place him fairly and squarely under the hammer if any royal commission is convened to investigate the corruption allegations. ,34,TimOfAltona
4896,"..and yes, your anti-dumping argument is valid. An anti-dumping authority was commissioned, under Gillard I think, but it seems to be toothless tiger. They have apparently determined that Italian canned tomatoes were in fact 'dumped' but no action has been taken that I can see to curtail the activity. ",50,TimOfAltona
4897,To the lefties on here trying to drum up support for a rag tag anti-government 'march'' - thanks so much for confirming in the minds of Australian voters why we voted for a Coalition government - there is no place for radical extreme leftwing crazies marching through our streets. ,50,TimOfAltona
4898,"I'm with you - that's the best way we can help keep SPC afloat - the problem is the supermarket duopoly who 'home brand' using cheap and clearly inferior imported product from China, Italy, South Africa etc are not supporting SPC - then again ,they would not sell the cheap imports if consumers did not buy them. Hmmmmmm..",58,TimOfAltona
4899,"Pal, these businesses were already on the way out under the socialist Labor government, Gillard kept throwing our money to prop up manufacturing businesses (presumably at the direction of the ACTU et al) yet they still floundered and shut down and guess what? - our debt levels blew out to mega proportions. ",53,TimOfAltona
4900,"There is only so much a government can do to prop up uncompetitive industries, the biggest being to manage the economy in such a way that business can flourish and be competitive - this where Labor fail time and time again and it's up to conservative governments to recalibrate the economy following Labor administrations (best as global pressure will allow) and get the nation back in business.",67,TimOfAltona
4901,Two very different propositions - you are trying to link climate change measures with a failing manufacturing business. - a business that was also failing terribly under the 6 years of a Labor government.  ,36,TimOfAltona
4902,"The ball is back in the court of Coca Cola Amatil, the parent company that posts hundreds of millions of dollars profit each year - if they can see a future for this business i.e.: it will actually survive then they will come to the party.",46,TimOfAltona
4903,The CFMEU saga rolls on and will only benefit the government and may well be the catalyst for the Coalition retaining government in 2016. A royal commission into the building industry will open up a massive can of worms for the ALP which is why we see Labor and their supporters so desperate to shut it down before it starts. ,61,TimOfAltona
4904,"The 'stoush' with Indonesia over people smugglers has benefitted the government enormously - apart from the small group of Labor/Greens supporters who 'befriended' both the Indonesian government and the people smugglers right to send boats laden with asylum seekers to our shores, most Australians appreciate the governments efforts in shutting down the people smugglers and taking a firm approach with Indonesia over this. A winner for the government. ",69,TimOfAltona
4905,"Great decision by the government - if SPC's owner, one of the largest multinationals in the world regard SPC as too risky and won't put up the money, then why should the Australian taxpayer? ",35,TimOfAltona
4906,"Generally of a high quality - not sure which government allowed them to accept commercial sponsorship in the form of commercials, but it was a good move and means they will be around for a long time to come.",39,TimOfAltona
4907,The ABC will always be with us - at least for the next 30 years or so. The Australian political merry go round of Liberal/Labor/LiberaI/Labor federal governments will see to that.  ,33,TimOfAltona
4908,Your point re public broadcasting service is valid and I think it is important to keep free access to some MSM digital news services. ABC news coverage is by and large of a pretty good standard in my opinion.,39,TimOfAltona
4909,"Yep, the people smugglers, Indonesian government, asylum seekers making confected claims against the navy and now the ABC - all have never had better friends than the Labor/Greens cheer squad.",30,TimOfAltona
4910,You need to go back and remember the events surrounding the ABC being awarded the International Broadcasting rights under a highly contentious and botched tender process by the Gillard government. ,31,TimOfAltona
4911,"Jim I would add that Australia does bear it's fair share of accepting genuine asylum seekers through the UNHCR program and yes, most of these asylum seekers end up assimilating well into Australian communities and make a solid contribution to Australia's future. ",43,TimOfAltona
4912,You would agree that there has to be some kind of border control or this situation would be completely out of hand with potentially thousands attempting the sea crossing each month outside the UNHCR program. ,36,TimOfAltona
4913,"Get into the real world - the same procedure is used in camps all over the world, it's for everyones' safety - children are quite capable of hiding something that could harm themselves or others and if adults thought that children were exempt from searches imagine some of the tragic consequences. ",52,TimOfAltona
4914,Had Rudd won the last election and he and Tony Burke were administering the policy they introduced before the election (Manus and Nauru) then 70% of the commentators in these Guardian threads would be supporting the Labor government's efforts to deter and shut down the people smugglers and stop the drownings.,51,TimOfAltona
4915,"Pat, you well know that police have few powers when it comes to investigating corruption allegations such as these. They cannot interview someone who does not wish to be interviewed - and guess what - none of the union people involved will speak or co-operate with a police investigation. ",50,TimOfAltona
4916,Only a royal commission has the wide ranging powers necessary and required to cut through to the truth - and therein lies the problem for the ACTU and their political arm and why they are so actively campaigning against it (along with the Labor supporters on the Guardian site).,49,TimOfAltona
4917,But the reality there is an abundance of wrong doings that will probably be uncovered by a Royal Commission - the last thing Dave Oliver and the leader of his political arm Bill Shorten want exposed is the alleged endemic corruption within some sectors of the union movement. ,49,TimOfAltona
4918,Abbott has only been PM for a few months and parliament has only sat for a short time - give him time to get plenty legislation through this year. ,30,TimOfAltona
4919,We are NOT ion conflict with Indonesia and we are NOT the laughing stock of the world - that's only in the minds of a few Labor/Greens supporters who are still living in denial. ,35,TimOfAltona
4920,I thought it was Rudd &amp; Gillard who had done more harm to Australia in the last 4 years - their infighting and back stabbing nearly wiped out the ALP.,30,TimOfAltona
4921,The ALP are crying because News Ltd refuses to be their lap dog. To attack and besmirch journalists for doing their job in holding Government accountable and referring to them as being unfaithful and unpatriotic is a warning sign of a despot at the helm. ,46,TimOfAltona
4922,There is growing suspicion both within the ABC and other sources that the Navy 'toture' allegations were fabricated by the people concerned who were acting on advice to try and rip compensation from the Aust govt. ,37,TimOfAltona
4923,"The people who fabricated these allegations had plenty of instant supporters in the Labor/Greens cheer squad who saw it as an easy means to land blows on the government, but the ABC should have been a little more circumspect over such allegations.",42,TimOfAltona
4924,To the contrary - the Coalition are right on track to win the next 2 terms.The Abbott government is increasing it's electoral support as it delivers on pre-election promises. ,30,TimOfAltona
4925,On your first point I disagree - she was a shambles during the Rudd-Gillard war of the roses - tried to back both sides and then got herself all twisted up and started sprouting John McTernan scripted nonsense. ,39,TimOfAltona
4926,On your second point - you gotta feel sorry for Bill - won't be able to drop into his mother-in-laws Canberra pad and quaff taxpayer funded bottles of beaujolais over his tax payer funded dinners for much longer. ,39,TimOfAltona
4927,And yes - I agree with you on his leadership which is also felt by a large number of the Labor cheer squad - I keep saying - you should have gone with Albo when you had the chance. ,40,TimOfAltona
4928,I don't see how becoming an 'independent' would give her more influence in federal government - I would say the opposite is true given the massive majority the Coalition have in the Lower House. ,35,TimOfAltona
4929,You have got yourself confused again - Whyalla wiped off the map was a quote by a union official - here's the cut and paste from the Adelaide Advertiser - ,31,TimOfAltona
4930,Clearly the Labor cheer squad are getting concerned that Turnbull will replace Abbott and go on to keep the Coalition in power for the next 10+ years. Nothing like a little pre-emptive character assassination on Turnbull - just in case eh comrade?.,42,TimOfAltona
4931,"Another litany of grubby personal attacks by bitter and twisted Labor supporters - not one of them could even name who the Labor candidate is - they don't care, it could be a balloon with a face painted on it and they would be still be blindly supporting it. (Let the Googling begin!) ",54,TimOfAltona
4932,Bill came close to unseating a sitting PM at the last election - he had a significantly higher primary vote than Rudd - but Labor's coalition partner the Greens pushed Rudd across the line. ,35,TimOfAltona
4933,"I know the Labor suppporters are out for revenge given Abbott and his team wiped the floor with Labor at the last election, but even the ALP hierarchy must be embarrassed by many of the grubby and unhinged comments on here. ",42,TimOfAltona
4934,Actually it was Indonesia's SBY who famously said about the Labor government - if you put the sugar out onto the table it will attract people smugglers...... which is what Labor did and look at the result....don't go all silent on us now.,43,TimOfAltona
4935,You keep banging on about how Labor have stopped the boats - funny you never seem to comment on how Labor started the whole people smuggling fiasco back in 2007 under Rudd - tens of thousands of asylum seekers arriving in people smuggler boats and 1000+ lives lost at sea and billions of dollars cost to the Aust tax payer. ,61,TimOfAltona
4936,Not sure why this is even a news story apart from the fact that it confirms the Coalition are delivering on their election promise to stop the boats - don't the left hate it when we hear of the success of Operation Sovereign Borders - they desperately want the boats to keep reaching Australia. ,55,TimOfAltona

4945,What all the lefties have 'overlooked' in all their abuse aimed at Morrison and the govt is that Morrison appeared voluntarily at the hearing - he asked to attend. ,30,TimOfAltona
4946,Perhaps if Indonesia tackled the endemic corruption on their side that permits the people smugglers to flourish and the boats heading out to sea then we would not be having this conversation and you wouldn't need to trawl the Indonesian press trying to find something that may be criticism of the Australian government so you can report back to your fellow Labor/Greens cheer squadders on here. ,67,TimOfAltona
4947,Come clean Alan - you know as do we that had Pezzullo been sitting next to Tony Burke at that senate hearing you would be praising him for his astute insights into how the Labor government was tackling the people smuggling problem. ,43,TimOfAltona
4948,"Poor guy, the Labor supporters attack anyone and everyone who are linked to the new government - the grubby comments about the new GG the other day spring to mind. ",31,TimOfAltona
4949,"Yes I am happy to condone - along with the millions of other voters ready to put the Coalition back in for the second term as amongst other things, a reward for stopping the boats.",35,TimOfAltona
4950,Here's the thing - Stopping the boats was a key plank in Abbott's successful election campaign...the left (as evidenced by so many of the comments on here) so desperately want the Coalition to fail in stopping the boats - they lavish the thought that the government fails in it's election commitment so they can claim Abbott a liar....they are shit scared the government will actually succeed in it's promise and go on to secure a further term in 2016 - so all that's left is to attack any measure the government initiate and show as much support for the people smugglers and the Indonesian government in the hope that boats keep arriving here. ,114,TimOfAltona
4951,"It's the other way round actually - the harder Indonesia play the ball the higher the popularity of the Coalition will skyrocket - feel sorry for the Labor/Greens cheer squad, they'll be left behind in the wake in their cesspool of bitterness and resentment.",44,TimOfAltona
4952,"Yep, let's all rally behind and support the people smugglers and the Indonesian government - until of course there is a change of government and then we can all rally behind the Labor government to stop the boats.",38,TimOfAltona
4953,Spot on - the thing is they don't give a toss about the reef nor the asylum seekers - they are purely convenient platforms they think they can land cheap blows against the government as payback for Sept last year. ,41,TimOfAltona
4954,The water around the jetty at Abbot point is pristine and full of marine life as you would find anywhere along the whole QLD coast line - the jetty has actually provided a great habitat for the marine life to flourish. ,42,TimOfAltona
4955,"You won't find one because as part of the 47 environmental safeguards built into this spoil will be dumped in a clearly defined disposal area well away from the reef on seabed consisting of sand, silt and clay which does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds. ",48,TimOfAltona
4956,"Anyone only exposed to the comments in this thread could be excused for thinking that the Abbott government had just wiped out the Great Barrier Reef, which of course is the impression they want people to have - it greatly assists with their campaign of vilification against the government.

4964,The stupidity of Notright's comment is that had Paul Barry revealed he had voted for Labor then all that nonsense about shutting down the ABC would have never been written. ,31,TimOfAltona
4965,Pretty gutsy of Paul Barry to announce to the world he voted Liberal at the last election - I know he was making a point about perceptions/assumptions he felt people had made about him - but good on him for having the balls to say what he felt he had to say. ,53,TimOfAltona
4966,"Just a suggestion - calling people childish names tends to derogate your reputation in these threads - that aside, while I agree with you that the ABC reported them as allegations, many of the left commenting in here immediately took the asylum seekers burns allegations as factual and started accusing the Abbott govt, and the RAN as torturers of defenseless people etc etc....it went on for days. ",68,TimOfAltona
4967,Interesting that the ALP opposition were virtually silent on this - perhaps many of their supporters who now have egg all over their faces should have followed the lead of their party.,32,TimOfAltona
4968,"It's a crying shame that the (seemingly) same degree of public anger and disgust is not directed towards the poaching of endangered animals in Africa - Elephants, Tigers and Gorillas will be wiped out hundreds of years before sharks ever will thanks to poachers and the mainly Asian crime syndicates funding them. ",53,TimOfAltona
4969,"I'd love to see those who have the financial clout, eg Richard Branson, Bill Gates etc pour some money into protecting these animals from the poachers and therefore extinction in the wild. Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania do not have the infrastructure or resources to stop the killing.",48,TimOfAltona
4970,Not sure Pat that events way down in Shepparton will have much bearing on the Griffith election - I would say voters will have made up their mind as to their voting intentions some time ago. ,37,TimOfAltona
4971,I've done the Cadbury chocolate tour down in Hobart a few years ago - plenty of free samples along the way and interesting watching how all the product is manufactured and packaged. ,33,TimOfAltona

4973,Actually you will find that the looming SA and TAS state elections are the two that will signal a vote of confidence in the performance of the federal government. Griffith is a mere sideshow compared to two full on state elections. ,42,TimOfAltona
4974,"As you now, both of these are Labor governments and if the conservative federal government is as terrible as you and your comrades make out then Labor are a certainty to hold onto government in those two states.",38,TimOfAltona
4975,You see there are some practicalities that need to be addressed here - simply calling for the PM to stand down is simplistic in the extreme because that person needs to be replaced. ,34,TimOfAltona
4976,"Hey Andi - I'd prefer you stick to the issue but since you raise the 'cheer squad' term - can you suggest another term one could use to describe the group of rabid pro-Labor/Greens commentators infecting (sorry, offering a fair and balanced appraisal of the PM and the government) in the Guardian threads? ",54,TimOfAltona
4977,"SPC manufacturing plant is far from going under - despite the confected and highly misleading rants from the Labor cheer squad that the Abbott government has wiped it out - there is a strong prospect that between the Vic government and the fabulously profitable owners CCA, the plant will survive without the Australian taxpayers having to borrow more money to inject into the company. ",65,TimOfAltona
4978,I know precisely how government works....that's why I can't fathom why the cheer squad keep calling for Abbott to stand down before the next election....what do they think would happen after that? ,33,TimOfAltona
4979,If you want I can keep dumbing the question down as much as I can until one or two of the cheer squad comprehend what I'm asking - I don't hold out much hope though.,35,TimOfAltona
4980,"Perhaps a touch poignant was his remark about CCA, SPC's parent, having a stronger balance sheet than the Commonwealth of Australia. You only have to go back to the last 6 years of an ALP government to source the reason for that situation. ",44,TimOfAltona
4981,"Abbott is spot on, why should we, the Australian taxpayer have to go out and borrow money to fund SPC when the owner of the business is reaping hundreds of millions of dollars profit each year?",36,TimOfAltona
4982,"So CCA are so convinced that SPC has a great future that it is kicking in nearly $200m, yet want the government to kick in $25m or else all bets are off? ",33,TimOfAltona
4983,"Cosgrove's appointment sure copped a lot of criticism from many Labor supporters, but I suspect it did not matter who Abbott nominated - he/she would have been shot down in flames solely on the basis it was Abbott's pick.",39,TimOfAltona

4987,"In the meantime we will enjoy good governance from the Abbott government - sorting out Labor's dysfunction of the past 6 years and overhauling the IR landscape to take this country forward over the next 25 years - as Howse rightly said, the unions need to get on board with improving relations with business and the Abbott government and all work together to arrive at a win-win outcome.",68,TimOfAltona
4988,"Like Gillard, the next Labor PM will be a product of the union movement - Shorten is damaged goods as are most of the mob left over from Gillard's front bench, Burke, Bowen etc. ",35,TimOfAltona
4989,I see the remnants of the pro-Gillard cheer squad are active in this thread - a little bit of payback perhaps for when all of Australia was demanding Gillard apologise for her No Carbon Tax lie? ,37,TimOfAltona
4990,"I seem to recall Morrison and Abbott were quick to refute the claims - I seem to recall the usual people in these threads, perhaps you too, branding them liars and quickly backed the asylum seekers claims as being factual and the government were lying. ",46,TimOfAltona
4991,The transition from 6 years of Labor to a conservative government has not gone well for the disaffected cheer squad. Some are still bitter and twisted &amp; yet to accept that there are many years to go with their beloved Labor/Greens party sitting aimlessly on the opposition benches.  ,50,TimOfAltona
4992,"Good to see Abbott taking a stand on something he and the government feels strongly about - he has the support of most Australians on this issue, the ABC jumped in too early before the facts were available. ",39,TimOfAltona
4993,"Look at the litany of debacles - The Julia Gillard experiment, the Anna Bligh experiment, the Kristina (I'm no ones girl) Keanelly experiment - all ending in a flood of tears for Labor. ",34,TimOfAltona
4994,You should not discount the anger still generated by Labor's multi-billion dollar desalination plant white elephant. This is costing Victorians dearly each year and millions of dollars in operating costs - all without a single drop of water being produced. ,41,TimOfAltona
4995,If you want an earlier election - set your sights on the Labor governments in TAS and SA. Perhaps you had better start supporting them - they need all the help they can get.,34,TimOfAltona
4996,"Apart from the human cost, this allegedly corrupt union activity has pushed the cost of construction through the roof in all the capital cities which in turn is passed on to tenants of commercial properties which in turn is passed onto the consumer. ",44,TimOfAltona
4997,"Pat, Labor and Shorten's problem is that a Royal Commission could publicly reveal the links between the ALP and a culture of alleged union corruption and alleged corrupt union officials - the yet to be determined Craig Thomson affair is a case in point. ",45,TimOfAltona
4998,I'm hopeful the commission does drag on for some time - in fact the findings should be be handed down in 2016 - just to remind Australia why they want to keep the union directed ALP government out for another one or terms at least. ,46,TimOfAltona
4999,Somehow I suspect that there is more leadership turmoil headed Labor's way in any case.. Labor will more than likely remind people why we don't vote for them without the aid of a Royal Commission.,35,TimOfAltona
5000,"So other words, Shorten is against a Royal Commission because he is trying to protect the government from any nasty surprises that may come out of it and embarrass the government. ",32,TimOfAltona
5001,Labor are torn as to whether they emulate his success or they persue different tack. They tried in a ham fisted way to emulate Abbott in the last sitting of parliament and it was a disaster for them. ,39,TimOfAltona
5002,Police cannot compel witnesses or alleged offenders to speak to them - corrupt union officials or those with knowledge of corrupt activity will simply not co-operate with police to frustrate the investigation. ,33,TimOfAltona
5003,"Royal Commission can subpoena witnesses and compel them to answer questions under threat of imprisonment for non-compliance - yet then again, if they have nothing to hide they should be happy to co-operate with the investigation - right? ",39,TimOfAltona
5004,"While he did not get across the line due to Greens preferences, he seems to have won on primary vote and also seems to have enabled a swing away from Labor in that seat. ",35,TimOfAltona
5005,Instead we are focussing on a pissant he said she said where 3 people got burns on their hands and are making spurious claims against our Navy no doubt encouraged by all manner of left wing sympathisers and the people smugglers who have so much to lose if the Abbott government suceeds. ,53,TimOfAltona
5006,I'm sure she is a lovely person - only issue is she is a product of the trade union movement - not sure that what the people of Griffith are necessarily looking for in an ALP candidate to replace Rudd. ,41,TimOfAltona
5007,Arcane's ramblings are eerily out of that period of German history when Axel Springer was seen by the left-wing Baader Meinhoff group as the newspaper mogul bogeyman propping up the conservative West German government.,34,TimOfAltona
5008,It only took the host of Media Watch to reveal that he too voted for Abbott in the last election and he was profoundly abused and ridiculed by those I like to call the Labor/Greens cheer squad. They take no prisoners here mate.,43,TimOfAltona
5009,Looking the other way and hoping it all gets airbrushed out of the history books is shameful but is pretty much what the Labor cheer squad stand for in this debate,31,TimOfAltona
5010,You need to stop supporting the people traffickers and the people making spurious accusations against the Navy and start backing your own government in it's efforts to stamp out the human trafficking of asylum seekers. ,36,TimOfAltona
5011,"On the other hand if Johnson was a LABOR Defence Minister, he would be doing a great job under difficult circumstances and he would have your full support in his criticism of the ABC.  ",36,TimOfAltona
5012,"What I do remember are in the 6 years Labor were in power some 1000+ men, women and children perished at sea following Labor's changes to Howard's Pacific Solution. ",30,TimOfAltona
5013,The Labor Party and the Greens have been in a coalition for ages - they preference flow each other like crazy - you're right I should be more specific - the next LNP government sworn in in 2016.,38,TimOfAltona
5014,They go on the premise that 99% of tourists will never return so they try and extract as much money from you as they possibly can while you are there. ,31,TimOfAltona
5015,-The high Australian dollar-Very small and highly competitive domestic market-Wages &amp; conditions being driven up to the point we are uncompetitive-Japan's looming Free Trade agreement with Korea and other countries.  ,32,TimOfAltona
5016,"Not sure this, or the previous Labor government could have kept pumping hundreds of millions of dollars of tax payers money to try and keep the industry afloat.Maybe the AMWU could have done more to re calibrate wages and conditions? ",41,TimOfAltona
5017,The CEO of Toyota has declared praise for the Abbott government for their assistance to Toyota over this matter - the same praise went to the previous Labor government. ,30,TimOfAltona
5018,"Time for the Labor cheer squad to take a deep breath, perhaps a nice cup of tea, and think before they blindly type out their usual venom and hatred? ",30,TimOfAltona
5019,I don't see anywhere where Toyota are holding the government to blame for this decision - the only ones bitching about that are the usual Labor cheer squad and ALP and unions trying to shift blame to the government. ,40,TimOfAltona
5020,"The Toyota decision has been brewing for quite some time......the high Australian dollar, very small &amp; highly competitive domestic market, AMWU pushing up wages that could no longer be sustained all complete the perfect storm for Toyota to exit Australian manufacturing. ",42,TimOfAltona
5021,This government will return the budget to surplus - unlike the hapless Swan and Gillard who were regularly assuring us Labor would return to surplus as the debt blew out by hundreds of millions around them each month. ,39,TimOfAltona
5022,AIG is probably correct - too much too soon would not be in the country's best interest. I think the voters would be happy if the government could return to surplus during the third term - Hockey just needs to demonstrate the coalition are reversing Labor's fiscal mismanagement.,48,TimOfAltona
5023,"They know only too well the findings could keep the ALP out of government for a generation - perhaps when Paul Howes eventually makes his way into the Leader of the Opposition role, which he will, Labor may have a chance at forming government. ",45,TimOfAltona
5024,"So if I read your post correctly, any corrupt union officials have never had a better friend than in the Labor/Greens cheer squad - you guys will protect them and make sure they can continue with their alleged corrupt activity. ",41,TimOfAltona
5025,"They can join the growing list of Labor/Greens cheer squad friends - People Smugglers, Indonesian government, asylum seekers with spurious claims about burns on their hands, SPC employees, Holden employees, bush fire arsonists (always good for blaming Abbott for causing bush fires), people breaking the law in other countries and then expecting the government to bail them out - the list keeps growing and growing.",65,TimOfAltona
5026,If you are referring to the senate inquiry you have yourself all confused - Morrison requested that he attend and provide comment. He was not required to attend by the hearing committee - Morrison went by his volition.,38,TimOfAltona
5027,None of them can see that Labor itself played a big part in it's own downfall - just look at the dysfunctional Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years with revolving leaders and revolving ministers. ,31,TimOfAltona
5028,"Carr did present well on this issue this morning but I suspect he went overboard when he declared that had Labor won last Sept, Holden and Toyota would not be leaving Australia. ",33,TimOfAltona
5029,The Toyota decision to exit manufacturing in Australia has taken perhaps 2 to 3 years to determine. This has not just come about in the past 2 or 3 weeks.  ,32,TimOfAltona
5030,He has turned what was once a safe Labor seat into a seat entirely up for grabs by the LNP in future elections - not only a 5.5% swing away from Labor since last Sept but also a seat occupied by a Labor PM!. ,45,TimOfAltona
5031,"Errr....Labor would have been wiped off the face of the planet at the polls - well maybe ending up with 25 seats or so - yes indeed, it is a shame she did not stick around.",36,TimOfAltona
5032,Not too sure about Plibersek ever going places - I suspect with her if you scratch below the surface there aint much going on - everything she says comes across as smirking confected anger - a tactic she learned from the old McTernan inspired 'Handbag Hit Squad' days of the failed Gillard administration.,53,TimOfAltona
5033,It's almost as if they know within themselves they have many long years ahead of them on the opposition benches and all the energy has drained out of them. ,30,TimOfAltona
5034,Could it be they thrive on bad news they feel they can attribute to conservative governments and get very frustrated when people's jobs are saved and things work out well in the end?,33,TimOfAltona
5035,The last thing we from the Labor cheer squad want is for the government's policy to actually work - it could keep us out of government for the next 2 terms.,31,TimOfAltona
5036,Of course Tas and SA Labor ministers are going to try and bring you down. They just want to get in first before they are spectacularly brought down in the forthcoming state elections. ,34,TimOfAltona
5037,Stick to your version and this will all blow over in a couple of days and the lefties will go back to trying to come up with new ways the people smuggling boats can break through Tony Abbott's ring of steel on our northern borders.,45,TimOfAltona
5038,Looking at these comments - all 766 of them so far - I can't but help make the observation that had this occurred under a Labor government we would be lucky to see a dozen or so comments in this Guardian thread.  ,44,TimOfAltona
5039,Fair to say that ANY information the police can provide the public that helps identify the criminals who gang raped a 14 year old girl is appropriate - particularly as this alleged 'gang' were still at large and having at least some information may help some other innocent girl being attacked or worse. ,54,TimOfAltona
5040,"How would Siv feel if this was her daughter or sister attacked and packed raped? Pretty sure she would support anything that brings the culprits before the courts including calling them asian, black african, white, Middle Eastern appearance, Pacific Islander or anything that may help catch these grubs.",48,TimOfAltona
5041,"Actually no Julie - I said at the time I thought Bracks was a fair appointment - the problem for him was two-fold, Gillard appointed him without consulting the Opposition (when it was clear to even the most rusted on Labor supporters that they were about to receive a shellacking at the polls) and secondly, Bracks went on and made the mistake of campaigning against the Coalition in the lead up to the election yet still expected them to honor Gillard's appointment.",82,TimOfAltona
5042,"Call me a cynic, but something tells me that it matters not whom Julie Bishop appoints to the role - that person would be mercilessly attacked by the Labor/Greens cheer squad as being hopelessly inadequate and no where near the quality of Gillard's pick Steve Bracks. ",47,TimOfAltona
5043,Gillard was warned against filling this role so close to a federal election without consulting the opposition yet she went ahead &amp; appointed Bracks - yet another one of her 'Captains Pick' consumed in controversy.,35,TimOfAltona
5044,Good to see a recent President of the ALP working closely with the Abbott government on indigenous youth initiatives and wholly supportive of Tony Abbott's agenda in this area. ,30,TimOfAltona
5045,I find it bizarre that the Labor/Greens cheer squad try to air brush that shameful period out of the history books by focussing on a couple of people with alleged burnt fingers.,32,TimOfAltona
5046,Scott Morrison did a great job on Insiders this morning - it's comforting to know we have a strong Minister and a strong competent government in control sorting out Labor's mess of the past 6 years. ,37,TimOfAltona
5047,"After Labor had a revolving door of Immigration Ministers because they were all failing in their portfolios - we have a Minister who's in control, delivering on the pre-election promises and testament to why we voted in this Coalition government. ",41,TimOfAltona
5048,Upsetting the Indonesian's was always going to be part of this solution - the Indonesian's were never going to like Australia 'stopping the boats' because they view themselves as a 'transit country' and and want them moved onto Australia as soon as possible to become our problem. ,48,TimOfAltona
5049,How about telling the servos not to take advantage of this by pushing the price of fuel in Victoria up by 20c/l overnight on the back of this news? ,30,TimOfAltona
5050,Call me crazy but I just know it's only a matter of time before an Australian Labor/Greens supporter blames this volcanic eruption on the Australian PM Tony Abbott.  ,30,TimOfAltona
5051,"Shaun, you have got yourself all mixed up over this...the asylum facility is contained within the PNG Manus Island naval compound which is PNG government owned/controlled- to reach the compound you need to enter the naval base and then proceed to the asylum camp in the middle of the base. They have not taken anything away from tribal owned land. ",61,TimOfAltona
5052,"Jim, I don't ever recall your outrage and calling for Kevin Rudd to resign or be sacked for the 1000+ DEATHS at sea after Labor rolled out the red carpet to people smugglers and asylum seekers.  ",38,TimOfAltona
5053,these people in detention on Manus are free to leave PNG anytime they choose - they are not prisoners nor in a concentration camp that so many Labor/Greenssupporters espouse daily. ,31,TimOfAltona
5054,The only proviso is they do not come to Australia. They CAN come to Australia if they go through the orderly UNHCR program - not by entering in illegal boats via people smugglers in a free for all.,38,TimOfAltona
5055,"Before the Labor/Greens cheer squad start the usual support/welcome for asylum seekers entering Australia illegally coupled with grubby attacks on the government, best to wait and determine the facts surrounding the unrest and tragic death on Manus. ",38,TimOfAltona
5056,I reckon the Labor party did a pretty good job of destroying her character - look what they did to her - tossed her out like an old limp lettuce leaf onto the compost heap of failed politicians.,38,TimOfAltona
5057,You can blame Labor for the tax decision - they set this up in 1989 and were well aware of the $880m going to NewsLtd before the last election.. ,30,TimOfAltona
5058,You too are also confused....this tax legislation was all set up under Labor back in 1989...the payment would be going through from the ATO irrespective of who is in govt today.  ,33,TimOfAltona
5059,Err.. it was the ATO providing the refund as far as I can make out from the article - you just made the other part up - in fact everything you say is fabricated.,34,TimOfAltona
5060,Here's a tip - you will see that the local Hare Krishna chapter will have a larger group on the street than you - perhaps join up with them and it will make your numbers look a little larger. Just a suggestion.,42,TimOfAltona
5061,"Jimbo...my point being why are the Labor/Greens cheer squad jumping up and down about 1 reported death (the cause of which is undetermined) and calling for Royal Commissions, ministerial resignations, sacking of ADF chiefs and the like. ",38,TimOfAltona
5062,Thousands of people have drowned under previous administrations with barely a peep from the left wing brigade - it's as if they those poor souls have already been airbrushed out of the history books by the left -unless of course it happens under a Coalition govt.,46,TimOfAltona
5063,"Oh..I misunderstood...you mean a Royal Commission into the 1000+ people who died as a result of the Kevin Rudd/ Julia ""I have complete confidence in the member for Dobell"" Gillard/Kevin Rudd administrations? ",33,TimOfAltona
5064,They know Labor are in no position to challenge at a state or federal level and won't be for many years - so I'd love to know who they think will govern? ,33,TimOfAltona
5065,Australia will now stand up for it's sovereign right to protect it's borders and we will determine who enters this country - not some cabal of grubby people smugglers wholly assisted by corrupt Indonesian officials. ,36,TimOfAltona
5066,The Abbott government are doing exactly what we would expert of them - kow towing to Indonesia may have been in the domain of a giggling Julia Gillard but we now have a much stronger government running the show. ,40,TimOfAltona
5067,It seems he has none - he along with Sarah Hanson-Young and Christine Milne appear to 'look the other way' and pretend it did not happen when people drown at sea in such huge numbers. Jeff you and the Greens have no answer to that apart from 'we prefer it if people don't try to come to Australia by boat'. ,61,TimOfAltona
5068,"Sorry Sarah - there are only so many Royal Commissions we can handle and Manus Island is not one of them - unless of course you would like to widen the terms of reference to include how the Labor/Greens government opened up our borders attracting, some say incentivising people to make the journey by boat which saw hundreds perish at sea? ",62,TimOfAltona
5069,I agree it is a bit of a litmus test for the federal government and I'm not sure how popular the Barnett Govt is in WA at the moment. The removal of the Carbon and Mining Taxes will work in favour of the Abbott government in WA.  ,49,TimOfAltona
5070,I doubt the distractions of the past few days will figure greatly in WA but I do agree that how people rate the Abbott government's performance thus far will play out in this election.,34,TimOfAltona
5071,I recall Labor had trouble keeping their ministers' in their portfolios for long - not sure how many Immigration ministers they went through when they were in govt. Telling. ,30,TimOfAltona
5072,"Morrison is doing a good job under difficult circumstances - he is successfuly implementing government policy and if the level of objection and confected outrage from the Labor/Greens cheer squad is any indication, the government is delivering on their promise. ",41,TimOfAltona
5073,But it is comrade - Labor caused this whole mess by opening up our borders in 2007 and were then unable to close them when they realised they had made the mother of all errors.,35,TimOfAltona
5074,Indonesia would not have even been aware that some naval ships had gone into their waters had the Australian government not alerted them to it and in doing so also apologised unreservedly.  ,34,TimOfAltona
5075,It seems only the left want to continue with their confected outrage over this - why? Because it is part and parcel of Abbott's 'Operation Sovereign Borders' and come hell or high water they want to see it fail and the boats keep arriving so they can claim a 'victory' over the government. ,54,TimOfAltona
5076,You are so determined to see the government's border protection policy fail and the boats keep arriving so you can claim a sordid 'victory' over the Abbott government and it's promise to stamp out people smuggling. ,37,TimOfAltona
5077,"None of you get it - this government is not going to give up on this - they will keep going and they will succeed - no matter how much you want the people smugglers to win, they will be beaten along with your hopes and dreams of Labor and the Greens getting back into government together within the next 9 years or so.",64,TimOfAltona
5078,Ex Labor MP Craig Thomson (and the ALP) must be thanking his lucky stars all this naval incursion into Indonesian waters bullshit is going on the same time he has been convicted for a raft of dishonesty offences relating to misappropriation of HSU members funds - it has taken the spotlight off him. ,54,TimOfAltona
5079,The Labor cheer squad are also breathing a sigh of relief that comments have not opened under the Thomson conviction story - they were having a lot of trouble figuring out how to blame Tony Abbott for Thomson's convictions.,39,TimOfAltona
5080,"Any chance you can do a segment on the Craig Thomson conviction and give us a replay of his speech in the House of reps where he stood up and denied everything to Parliament and blamed everyone else for his situation - also a couple of replays of a certain red haired PM saying ""I have full confidence in the member for Dobell' and my all time favourite ""This government has full confidence in the member for Dobell"" ",79,TimOfAltona
5081,"Best we all wait for the review to conclude, along with any police/coronial investigations as to the tragic cause of death - unfortunately you and the rest of the Labor/Greens cheer squad have all jumped the gun and made up what occurred to suit your own agendas.",47,TimOfAltona
5082,I'll readily admit to some degree of bias towards the Coalition but just look at parliament question time - the government have it all over a seemingly deflated and uninspiring opposition. The Leader and deputy leader of the opposition seem flat and wholly unconvincing in their questions - like they don't want to be there. ,56,TimOfAltona
5083,Good to know that Zena who not only appears to be a meteorologist but was also was on the ground when the riot occurred on Manus and saw everything that happened and can pass that information onto the authorities who are still investigating the incident. ,46,TimOfAltona
5084,I note that Labor are very quick to support the government over suggestions that he could be referred to the parliamentary privileges committee over allegations he mislead the house.  ,31,TimOfAltona
5085,The Liberals do not have information on corrupt unions because it is all hidden away in dark corners - the RC will shine a light into those dark corners and expose the people engaging in this activity with the outcome being the dismantling of union corruption. ,47,TimOfAltona
5086,Shorten is on shaky ground here - if he poo poos the RC before it starts and it goes onto exposing a raft of criminal offences he will be largely seen as running an ALP protection racket for certain unions and their corrupt activity. ,45,TimOfAltona
5087,Do the Greens have information on this that no one else has? They should pass it on to the relevant authorities who are investigating the death - that would be the responsible thing to do don't you think?,38,TimOfAltona
5088,Morrison's error was to prematurely release too much detail. He could have released a statement advising his department was still collating details of what occurred rather than running with unsubstantiated advice. ,32,TimOfAltona
5089,He has done the right thing in immediately correcting his earlier statement once more reliable information came to hand - most likely once Lieutenant General Angus Campbell had hit the ground at Manus to investigate the incident.,37,TimOfAltona

5097,Newsflash!!!! This is not the dysfunctional Labor party in government any more who change their minister's around every 3 or 4 months - the Coalition are a stable government who will see the job through and Scott Morrison is doing a fine job under difficult circumstances - he and the government will prevail. ,54,TimOfAltona

5112,She was way underrated and I would have loved to have heard more from her. If you don't know much about her check her out on Google - she has quite a background and so many accomplishments over her career - including surviving as a POW in Iraq after her Black Hawk was shot down and sustaining severe injuries and other atrocities at the hands of her captors.

5156,My point being that there has to be an orderly intake of refugees/asylum seekers which provides for transition and a necessary level of support facilities. This allows integration with existing communities and promotes understanding and acceptance from both the migrants and the communities they are joining.  ,48,TimOfAltona
5157,Allowing a free for all creates significant social and economic problems in the host country - I have lived in France and experienced first hand the impact of migrant ghettos which are virtually 'no go' areas for the gendarmes - try Clichy-sous-Bois in Paris for starters - reminiscent of downtown Mogadishu and that's being generous. ,56,TimOfAltona

5199,Actually Australians  think that refugees were attacked with intent to murder - only the Labor/Greens cheer squad try to perpetuate some kind of conspiracy myth that they alone get all excited and worked up about to try and land confected blows against the Australian government. ,47,TimOfAltona

5207,I suspect you have confused yourself over this issue - there are thousands of refugees and their families who would embrace and thank Scott Morrison for giving them the opportunity to settle in Australia and make a contribution to the Australian way of life - these are the refugees who come to Australia each year under the UNHCR program - Scott Morrison is referring to people paying people smugglers to get them to Australia on illegal boats with thousands drowning along the way - which refugees are you referring to?,90,TimOfAltona
5208,"I think most Australian's recognise that Morrison has done a good job where Labor failed over and over again - even with a late run to the right by Gillard and Rudd, Labor proved to be wholly incompetent when it came to protecting our borders. ",46,TimOfAltona

5211,The Labor/Greens cheer squad have been blindly using the mantra 'One term Tony' for months now - but none of them can say who would replace him - perhaps they think some kind of magical left leaning government will appear - we all know it won't be Labor under Shorten or the Greens under Milne so who can replace the Coalition - PUP perhaps? ,65,TimOfAltona

5281,I said from day 1 that Labor have no hope of winning an election with Shorten and Plibersek at the helm - it's going to take some more leadership shake ups to finally arrive at the leadership team Labor need to take them forward - Shorten and Plibersek are merely keeping the seats warm.,54,TimOfAltona

5293,The article fails to stipulate  of the 83 detainees being sent to alternative temporary accommodation are involved in legal action against the government - it also fails to mention that the detainees affected will have their cases heard at a later date irrespective of whether they are in WA or returned to Sydney when Villawood renos are completed. ,60,TimOfAltona

5311,Gillard was largely seen as a puppet of the union movement and Rudd was seen as being independent and able to move the party away from the influence of the union factions and was therefore despised by the Gillard 'camp'. ,41,TimOfAltona

5316,Border Protection was not an issue in yesterday's poll - the people of WA already know the government has successfully stopped the boats and I can assure you that the people of WA DO NOT want an armada of people smuggler boats turning up on their shoreline as was the case when Labor were in government.,56,TimOfAltona
5317,Like most people I have enormous difficulty in separating the two - Labor may just as well change their corporate colors from red to green and be done with it.,30,TimOfAltona

5324,The cheer squad are conflicted - they want Labor to get the credit for all the nice juicy FTA bits but the government to take the blame for bits they criticise. ,32,TimOfAltona
5325,"We now have unrivalled access to the world's 3rd largest economy - our beef, dairy and manufactured food producers will benefit - remember SPC? They now have access for their products to an economy 4 or 5 times larger than Australia's. ",42,TimOfAltona
5326,"The services sector will also benefit enormously - Australian firms engaged in finance, health, legal aged care and education now have the opportunity to expand into the massive Japanese market. ",31,TimOfAltona
5327,"Crown Casino is one of Victoria's largest non government employers - thousands of young Victorians depend on Crown for an income to survive. Crown Casino brings in hundreds of millions of dollars into the Victorian economy each year - this helps pay for our education, roads, hospitals, police and public transport. ",52,TimOfAltona
5328,You are so desperate to try and create/construct a link between Tony Abbott and anything/everything that is bad that you start to sound foolish in the extreme - unhinged. ,30,TimOfAltona
5329,His insight into historical animosity between Japan and China is revealing and clearly is something that none of the army of Asian experts accompanying the PM from DFAT had any knowledge or understanding of before they advised the PM the right language he should be choosing when discussing Sino-Japanese relations. ,51,TimOfAltona
5330,Get real - the PM's language was entirely appropriate and I'm pretty sure the Chinese are not looking to PM Abbott to heal decades of Chinese animosity towards Japan.  ,31,TimOfAltona
5331,We have somewhat of an upper hand here - China needs Australia for food and iron ore - both are high quality and relatively cheap to transport vs sourcing from South America or Africa. ,35,TimOfAltona
5332,It's just the beginning though and there is a very long journey ahead for Labor before they get their house in order to offer up a viable alternative government - 3 terms and 2 or 3 leadership changes at least. ,41,TimOfAltona
5333,"If you are suggesting the parents should be allowed out into the community because their baby was born on Australian soil - then all you are doing is creating a whole new class of refugee - have babies on Australian soil as a passport to enter Australia - how many heavily pregnant women would be boarding people smuggler boats then? Hundreds, thousands?",62,TimOfAltona
5334,"Hang on Davey boy, half the comments in these threads have been claiming this FTA as Labor's 'coup' and the Coalition only came in at the tail end and signed the deal - they want all the credit to go to the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd administrations - yet you say it is a dud deal and is a bad outcome for Australia. ",61,TimOfAltona
5335,In the context of what had happened so far - it was a breakthrough - unidentified material floating in the ocean which  be linked to the missing plane. ,30,TimOfAltona
5336,"Also, Abbott got that information from the 'experts' working on this - he was simply conveying their message as you do when you are a PM running a country and people look to you for information.",36,TimOfAltona
5337,"When Newspoll shows Labor in front and the Coalition trailing the poll is highly credible, extremely respected and very authoritative and an excellent reflection of how voters feel towards this government.",31,TimOfAltona

5339,"If you cut through all the Labor propaganda/bullshit the government has actually done a fairly good job in the first few months and no one is more committed to lifting our economy and getting debt under control than the government - in the long run, you, me and most Australians will benefit from this.",54,TimOfAltona
5340,"The problem with your preferred choice for PM is that the party associated with the PM needs a majority of seats in the Lower House - last time I looked at the makeup of the House of Reps, the Greens had 1 seat in a 150 seat house or 0.006% - now by my reckoning those numbers make it  difficult, if not impossible, for the Greens to form government or for that matter have any relevancy in the polls.

5342,"I would dearly love to write a Guardian piece - just to provide some (much needed) balance in the debate over Tony Abbott, the Coalition's first 6 months and the current state of the ALP and the Greens - it may not be as biased as some may think because yes, the government has made some errors, tactical and otherwise along the way - as all new governments invariably do. ",71,TimOfAltona
5343,"As much as the Labor cheer squad don't want to admit it, they know full well this current government and it's leader will go into a second term and perhaps a third. ",33,TimOfAltona
5344,"Err...I think you have got confused - this is the government of Nauru's decision - not the government of Australia's decision - as much as you try to attach blame/responsibility on everything that occurs on Tony Abbott, you fail once again on this particular issue.",45,TimOfAltona
5345,"Australia has diverse views on this subject ranging from one end of the spectrum the Greens who would allow free and open borders and allow anyone and everyone who wants to live here the ability to do so through to the extreme right-wing views of Tania Plibersek, Deputy Labor leader, who proposes unrestricted government surveillance of our daily personal electronic and communications activity.

5347,"It'll happen Col, it'll happen for Howse - it's all in the timing from here - he's got a bit of time because Labor are hopelessly stuck with Shorten until the next election.",33,TimOfAltona
5348,"Actually Col, I suspect many of the Labor voters may just head over to the good side after they realise Labor are done for and I reckon it's already started - Liberal Party membership has increased since the debacle of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd civil wars. ",45,TimOfAltona
5349,"Labor and the Greens have been attached to each other for ages - who can forget Julia Gillard fawning all over Bob Brown with hugs, kisses and big embraces as they consummated the marriage between the Greens and Labor. ",40,TimOfAltona
5350,"Labor should not be so quick to criticise the government who are doing nothing more than fixing up Labor's fiscal mess - Labor have very little, almost zero, credibility when it comes to managing the economy. ",37,TimOfAltona

5353,"Where was the money to pay for Labor's model - oh that's right there was none - we had to borrow, borrow, borrow and even then it was years behind schedule. ",32,TimOfAltona
5354,I distinctly recall Albanese going into hiding in the weeks before the election so he did not have to reveal the true extent of NBN cost blow outs plus stuff ups that had occurred under Labor - in fact he had a 'draft' stamp on his desk which was immediately applied to any reports that came to his office. ,60,TimOfAltona
5355,Cyclones have been occurring off the coast of northern Australia for thousands of years - where is the evidence that Ita is attributable to man made climate change? There is none. ,32,TimOfAltona

5357,"Perhaps if you didn't mis-represent everything trying to paint the failed Gillard in a positive light all the time your posts may be regarded as being a little more credible - but as it stands, not so much. ",39,TimOfAltona
5358,"Well, we all know who jumps for joy when a Labor government is elected in Australia - all the grubby low-life people smugglers operating out of Indonesia -for Labor to return to government so they can start up their vile trade again. ",43,TimOfAltona
5359,"Gotta say, the silence from the Labor party while Abbott has been on his trade mission to Japan, South Korea and China has been deafening - hellooooooo Labor - is anyone there????????",32,TimOfAltona
5360,The good thing about an article such as this is that it flushes out which of the regular Labor/Greens commentators are the Labor supporters and which are the Greens supporters. ,31,TimOfAltona
5361,Why Bill Shorten and Labor have allowed their 'junior' partner to take over as official spokesperson is beyond me...perhaps it's just indicative of the parlous and directionless state Labor find themselves in these days. ,35,TimOfAltona
5362,"In the meantime, the government is delivering on a number of pre-election promises and has just pulled off the most successful Prime Ministerial lead trade mission into Asia for decades. Great job guys.",33,TimOfAltona
5363,The Labor cheer squad really do display their ignorance in these threads - Peta Credlin is the PM's Chief of Staff - whenever a PM is on official overseas visits his/her Chief of Staff is at their side for official meetings.,41,TimOfAltona
5364,Of course the Labor/Greens cheer squad hate to see any initiative that portrays the Abbott government in a positive light and as expected the usual inane and grubby comments spew forth. ,32,TimOfAltona
5365,In the meantime Tony Abbot and his government are doing exactly what we voted them in to do - taking this country forward away from the disasters of dysfunctional Rudd/Gillard/Rudd debacles. ,32,TimOfAltona
5366,Abbott gave no-one false hope - the pings are believed by all the experts to be from the missing plane - which is exactly what the PM advised. The problem is they still cannot pinpoint the resting place of the aircraft - at no time has Abbott stated the plane has been located. ,54,TimOfAltona
5367,I'm surprised the usual hapless Labor cheer squad people are attacking him for being back in QLD for the emergency - had he stayed up in China they would all be attacking him for not being back in QLD. ,40,TimOfAltona
5368,"Gosh, we wouldn't want the Prime Minister of the country leading the search for the missing plane to say anything about it or perhaps look good or anything - unless of course it is a Labor PM hey!",38,TimOfAltona
5369,Their support for the people smugglers and their desperate pleas for the boats to keep on arriving is one of the key factors in their crushing defeat last Sept - yet they keep on cheering on the people smugglers and hoping any government initiative to stop the illegal trade is unsuccessful. ,52,TimOfAltona
5370,The Gillard government delivered some key bi-lateral initiatives with China but fell short of implementing any long term trade deals or sufficiently tackling the issue of SOE investments - Abbott is on the right track with a more inclusive strategy. ,41,TimOfAltona
5371,"Also, increased military co-operation with China, officer exchanges, joint exercises and the like is a smart move - our middle power ADF can benefit by working in closer partnership with the world's largest military power and will help diffuse China's reasonably valid perception that Australia's military is tied to the boot laces of the USA. (Who can forget Gillard fawning all over Obama up in Darwin when she announced US Marine bases for the top end - another Gillard 'error of judgment' she was so famous for?) ",88,TimOfAltona
5372,I think it highly unlikely that the leader of the country that is heading the search makes a comment and the press don't report it - that is fantasy land stuff and only proves that the Labor cheer squad are really concerned that Abbott will look good in all this.,50,TimOfAltona
5373,Good thought but the problem is it will need an area many times larger to accommodate the runways and necessary infrastructure - also there are a lot of homes and schools etc in the immediate area.,36,TimOfAltona
5374,There are things for and against this and it is a way off yet - I guess the scramble will be on amongst the airlines down the track - they will all want to keep their current spots at Mascot for passenger convenience. ,44,TimOfAltona
5375,"While cuts are unavoidable and will be made, hopefully natural attrition will account for a large percentage and others receive professional outplacement support services to get them into other jobs.",30,TimOfAltona
5376,The Coalition must reign in government spending. The country cannot sustain a situation where we spend more than we earn - we all look to this elected government to set us up for future prosperity. ,36,TimOfAltona
5377,Labor had their go and it didn't turn out so well - massive cost blow outs in infrastructure spending and billions and billions overseas borrowings. Certainly a factor in why they now sit in vastly reduced numbers on the opposition benches.,41,TimOfAltona
5378,It is not the government's fault the public service sector is bloated - you need to look at the previous Labor/Greens/Independent government to lay the blame for allowing the numbers and therefore costs to blow out. ,37,TimOfAltona
5379,It was never going to be sustainable and the audit commission has no doubt found that there is enormous job duplication and waste going on in the public service which needs to be corrected. ,35,TimOfAltona
5380,The CPSU saw this coming so they are getting in early to start firing their salvos over the fence at the government - with a new effective government not beholding to the ACTU they know there is little they can do to keep the public service bloated. ,48,TimOfAltona
5381,I seem to recall Gillard and then Rudd governments had started cutting the numbers back when they were in their dying months - so even they who had caused the numbers to blow out knew they were not sustainable. ,40,TimOfAltona
5382,The 4th panel should read - 'We knew even before we stepped onto the illegal people smuggler boat we would reach Australian shores - we knew we would be sent to processing camps in countries other than Australia because we chose to enter Australia outside the UNHCR program - we knew this but we paid the people smuggler and we came anyway. ,63,TimOfAltona
5383,The 2nd last panel should read - 'We know we were never going to be settled in Australia and we know the Australian government is working on a solution with other countries to take us in as refugees - we hope this happens quickly' ,45,TimOfAltona
5384,"'We know that getting on illegal boats in Indonesia is not the way to seek asylum in Australia, over 1000 people have drowned attempting that dangerous voyage. We hope that other people do not try to come to Australia this way and instead go through the UNHCR processing centres for genuine refugees just like tens of thousands of people have done before us'.",63,TimOfAltona
5385,All they can do is manufacture petty and childish comments to mask their concern that this government is actually delivering on the policies and initiatives we elected them to implement.,30,TimOfAltona
5386,"Speaking of communist countries, it's ironic that the Communist Party of Australia website is chock full of links to engastive Guardian articles about Tony Abbott and the government - in fact they have a whole page dedicated to Guardian articles - it's as if the Guardian is the preferred media of choice for the CPA - yet this is also the media of choice for many in the Labor/Greens cheer squad? ",72,TimOfAltona
5387,No unfortunately the refugees and their illegal boat operators are hanging around in the vain hope Labor and the Greens get back into power so they can be back in business once more. ,34,TimOfAltona
5388,"Sasha, - if the 'aftermath' you refer are the comments from half a dozen or so bitter and twisteds, inclusive of yourself, still reeling from last Septs crushing defeat then I don't think the government has too much to worry about.",41,TimOfAltona
5389,"Much the same as 'stopping the boats' makes the government look good and Labor, well, bad - this Royal Commission has the potential to rip the heart and soul out of the ALP. ",34,TimOfAltona
5390,"This is precisely where it all falls in a smouldering heap for the Labor cheer squad - there  no one waiting in the wings to replace the government....certainly not Labor, even with the customary help from your Greens partners. ",41,TimOfAltona
5391,"So as much as you lot keep vainly banging on about 'one-term Tony' unless you think Clive Palmer will be our next PM, I'm afraid the government you see before you today is the government you shall have for the next 2 o 3 terms at least. ",48,TimOfAltona
5392,"Speaking of Labor and the Greens, I have to say that those in these threads that lean towards Labor are certainly being dudded with Christine Milne seemingly the new spokesperson for the Labor/Greens coalition. ",35,TimOfAltona
5393,Why Bill Shorten and Labor have allowed their 'junior' partner to take over as official spokesperson is beyond me...perhaps it's just indicative of the parlous and directionless state Labor find themselves in these days.,34,TimOfAltona
5394,The Abbott government has just completed the most successful Prime Ministerial trade mission into Asia for decades - a feat acknowledged even by Labor to their credit - so not sure why a poll is of any significance or relevance so many years out from an election - even when polls show the government in front is meaningless this far out from an election. ,65,TimOfAltona
5395,"Also, why is it that the left-wing people fawn all over a poll that shows Labor/Greens in front but reject as 'rigged' any poll that show the government in front?",30,TimOfAltona
5396,Well what do you know - Labor finally came out and said something after giving the PM a free ride on what has arguably been Australia's most successful Prime Ministerial lead trade mission into Asia for decades. Always good to see Labor supporting this government. ,46,TimOfAltona
5397,"Unfortunately for Labor their first wimper in ages has only been Jason Clare jumping at shadows hoping someone, anyone out there will pay attention based on an unsubstantiated piece about the ABC in the Fairfax press. ",37,TimOfAltona
5398,"Weak as, Labor. While you wilt into the background and allow your coalition partner Christine Milne to be your official spokesperson, your irrelevancy is increasing as quickly as your collapsing vote.",31,TimOfAltona
5399,Well I guess with conservative governments pretty much in power across most of Australia - what happened to Labor anyway? - it is up to the Liberals to sort this out. ,32,TimOfAltona
5400,Labor had their turn and were found terribly wanting - partly why they have been turfed out around the country with little prospect of returning for quite a few years down the track. ,34,TimOfAltona
5401,Abbott and Baird will be teaming up to reform the Lobbyist regulations and enforcement in NSW - voters are looking to them to stamp out corrupt lobbyistpractices. I think NSW voters have a high dedgree of confidence that the Libs can achieve this with or without Labor support.,48,TimOfAltona
5402,So share with us who should be NSW Premier - you are keep to see the new Premier resign a day or so after he has been appointed but you offer no clues as to who should be Premier if not Mike Baird?,43,TimOfAltona
5403,"You expend copious amounts of time and effort in analysing and commenting on the Liberal Party - how about you put the same effort into analysing and assessing the Labor party - you know, just to mix it up a bit? ",42,TimOfAltona
5404,"You expend copious amounts of time and effort in analysing and commenting on the Liberal Party - how about you put the same effort into analysing and assessing the Labor party - you know, just to mix it up a bit? ",42,TimOfAltona
5405,Thanks - you proved me absolutely correct - you have no idea who should be NSW Premier - all you can do is blindly bag the incumbent because he happens to belong to party you do not support.  ,40,TimOfAltona
5406,I think Baird has done the right thing from Day 1 - frankly admitted mistakes have been made in the way lobbyists have been dealt with in the past. ,30,TimOfAltona
5407,In NSW that is an understatement and people now look to the new NSW cabinet to deal with this in an open and transparent manner - lobbyists have been interwoven in the fabric of Australian politics for decades - none more so than in NSW. ,46,TimOfAltona
5408,They look now to Baird and his new cabinet to introduce the stricter regulations surrounding lobbyist activity and how the regulations will be enforced - public transparency is the key. ,31,TimOfAltona
5409,Perhaps your argument may contain more credibility if your fellow Labor /Greens supporters did not continually try and link the blame/responsibility for every natural disaster that occurs on the planet with the Australian PM and/or the Australian government. ,39,TimOfAltona
5410,We all agree that climate change is a real - what we can't agree on is the degree (no pun intended) to which this is happening and the extent to which industrialisation contributes to this and what is the best course of action to minimise the impact of industrialisation on global climate change.  ,55,TimOfAltona
5411,"This very issue contributed to the undoing of two Labor PM's, first Rudd's ETS folly and then for pure political advantage Gillard (Bob Brown holding a gun to her head) imposed a tax which hit the hip pockets of all Australians and fair to say she paid the ultimate price for that decision. ",54,TimOfAltona
5412,"Diversity of opinion clearly does not sit well with the Labor/Greens cheer squad in these forums, particularly when that opinion differs from their own. They want it shut down. ",30,TimOfAltona
5413,Actually Albo and I think I am correct in guessing you will be reading these comments - speaking from the Liberal side of things we are more than happy Bill got the gig - you would have been a far more formidable opponent across the chamber.,46,TimOfAltona
5414,"C'mon Albo - come clean with the Australian people, you know very well this HSR fantasy is just a smokescreen - the real story is why Labor are in such disarray and struggling to make any progress since the debacle of the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd disaster that nearly left the party with 30 seats in the House of Reps. ",58,TimOfAltona
5415,It would be interesting to know what you would be doing to fix this if you had not been dudded at the leadership ballot by Shorten and his union mates.,30,TimOfAltona
5416,"Good to know - now let's see your same list for the Labor side of politics and, what the hell, let's throw Christine Milne into the equation as well ",30,TimOfAltona
5417,4 - The chick in QLD (can't be bothered Googling her) leading a team of 7 MPs' - absolutely zero chance of her ever being a QLD premier - may not last this current term ,36,TimOfAltona
5418,Baird answered the tough questions directly. Ferguson pulled no punches - must have given the Labor/Greens cheer squad a flutter of hope that she would trip Mike Baird up. ,30,TimOfAltona
5419,Notice I use the word  - something that has been a long time missing from the Labor side of politics and now it seems the Greens as well. ,30,TimOfAltona
5420,This why we have almost a clean sweep of conservative governments across Australia - Labor are too divided to offer a credible alternative government at state and most certainly federal level.,31,TimOfAltona
5421,I know all that about ICAC and the courts - my question is why have charges not been laid against those individuals with the mountain of evidence produced by ICAC?,30,TimOfAltona
5422,You have mis-represented the interview to suit your own agenda -Baird answered Ferguson directly and succinctly over Di Girolamo's donations to the Liberal party campaign - he did donate. ,30,TimOfAltona
5423,"You also intentionally omitted the very relevant comment by Baird, repeated two or three times that in hindsight the appointment of Di Girolamo to board of State Water was an error of judgement by the panel set up to recommend appointments and should not have occurred. Baird was clear an unequivocal in his response. ",55,TimOfAltona
5424,You Labor/Greens supporters need to understand that lobbying has formed part of the fabric of political life in Australia for decades - even the Greens are bombarded with lobbyists pushing a particular self-interest agenda. ,35,TimOfAltona
5425,"You Labor/Greens cheer squad types need to get your house in order - your party is in deep doo doo at the moment - can't sort itself out, almost leaderless, factions publicly tearing each other apart, unions won't give up their control/influence, is a mere bystander observing the Abbott government successfully implement pre-election promises and completes the most successful PM trade delegation to Asia in the nation's history and so on. ",72,TimOfAltona
5426,You and your handful of cohorts in these threads who think that by launching vile and grubby baseless attacks on the PM willsomehow deliver Labor into government are seriously deluding yourselves. ,32,TimOfAltona
5427,"Congratulations to Mike Baird, almost certain to be NSW Premier for the next term or two - NSW Labor havn't a snowflakes hope in hell of getting back into government for quite a few years ahead. ",37,TimOfAltona
5428,"Speaking of NSW Labor, you just gotta ask yourself the question - why are proven corrupt Labor grubs like Obeid and MacDonald still walking around the streets and getting on with their lives while a good, decent Premier falls on his sword and resigns over an undeclared bottle of wine? ",51,TimOfAltona
5429,"Are these two, and perhaps other Labor politicians going to be charged with anything or do they just be named as corrupt by ICAC and they carry on as if nothing ever happened? No consequences for their corrupt activity as senior NSW Labor party figures? ",46,TimOfAltona
5430,Of course you won't come back with any because there are non - in fact the only links you can come back with are where ICAC specifically said that O'Farrell is not corrupt or even suspected of having acted corruptly in this matter. ,44,TimOfAltona
5431,"What I can come back to you with are all the links that show O'Farrell was regarded as one of the cleanest and highest regarded Premiers NSW has ever had - this comes from both Liberal and Labor supporters, even left-wing commentators like David Marr agree. ",47,TimOfAltona
5432,Speaking of links - I can also come back to you with links that prove NSW Labor  manifestly corrupt when they were in office - there are thousands of links to choose from - all juicy proven stories about Eddie Obeid and Ian MacDonald and others - this is why the ALP were thrown out of office in NSW and never to return for quite a few years ahead. ,71,TimOfAltona
5433,I suspect your tragic and manifestly inaccurate comment was just a thought bubble you made up on the run to try and keep up with other tragic and manifestly inaccurate comments posted in these threads by Labor supporters looking for payback and trying to disguise the massive collapse in the ALP vote at a state and federal level.,58,TimOfAltona
5434,The Labor cheer squad are conflicted - they don't know whether to abuse Palmer or praise him. Most seem to be having a bet each way - just in case.,30,TimOfAltona
5435,Here's a tip - instead of constantly trying to disguise the fact you dislike conservative governments - why not just come out and admit you don't like to see conservative in power instead of beating around the bush. ,39,TimOfAltona
5436,"The funny thing is that had this exact same announcement been made by the previous Labor government, this thread would have around 30 comments instead of 380 and most of those would be congratulating the PM for being decisive and improving the economic prospects for both NSW and Western Sydney.  ",52,TimOfAltona
5437,"Because the announcement is being made by the, with the exact same outcomes, all the usual hapless Labor cheer squad people flood the thread with mind numbing childish propaganda. ",30,TimOfAltona
5438,"Two major victories for this government, a multi-billion dollar infrastructure announcement for Western Sydney creating tens of thousands of jobs plus the government has achieved what the Labor/Greens govt could never do - they have stopped the people smuggler boats arriving into Australian territory.  ",46,TimOfAltona
5439,Message to the Libs - if you want to make a clean sweep out West in 2016 - which is looking increasingly likely - better put up a better candidate in Greenway than Jaymes Diaz this time around. ,39,TimOfAltona
5440,"If I were Michelle Rowland I would be afraid, very afraid. Mind you she should not really even be in Parliament - fortunately for her an inept Liberal candidate slipped through the pre-selection process.",34,TimOfAltona
5441,One of the major international airlines are currently negotiating to fly in and out of Avalon - one of the Asian airlines I think plus Jetstar fly domestically out of there.,31,TimOfAltona
5442,"Well, given tens of thousands of new jobs will created and will be sourced primarily from the Western Sydney basin I'd say thats tens of thousands of more votes going to the Liberal candidates wouldn't you? ",37,TimOfAltona
5443,"While the 2nd airport has merit, Max Moore-Wilson does make a valid point about the current Sydney Airport - it has the potential to expand it's current operations for at least another 20 years or so, how? - get rid of or reduce the bloody curfew. ",47,TimOfAltona
5444,Most large International airports run 24/7 - Sydney has this ridiculous curfew because Anthony Albanese likes to get his 8 hrs sleep and won't tolerate those pesky planes flying over his house at mid-night. ,35,TimOfAltona
5445,"I say open up the curfew, throw in another 2 hrs at night and 2 hrs in the morning when planes can take off and land over Botany Bay and hey presto - there's another 60-80 flights per day taking pressure off the rest of the day and making better use of the airport's infrastructure by spreading the workload. ",60,TimOfAltona
5446,"Let's not forget that apart from freeing up the congestion at Mascot, this initiative will also create tens of thousands of jobs for young Australians' in the greater Sydney basin. ",31,TimOfAltona
5447,What we are seeing here is the PM and Baird making a transparent and genuine attempt to clean it up at a state and federal level for current and future governments. ,32,TimOfAltona
5448,"If Shorten survives, he should be thanking Tony Abbott for showing strong leadership in cleaning up the political wing of the ACTU - something the ACTU and Labor would never have been able to achieve for themselves.",37,TimOfAltona
5449,Time will tell if they are successful but good to see Abbott and Baird doing the right thing by trying to clean this up - Labor and the Greens will also benefit from this reform down the track. ,39,TimOfAltona
5450,"That's ok Crowery - you can fight off the enemy by sprinkling your magic Labor/Greens fairy dust, meanwhile in the real world the government is getting on with ensuring our defence capability is on par with potential threats.",38,TimOfAltona
5451,Reading many of these comments here makes you think perhaps Rudd made a mistake when he changed the 'rules' to give (himself) the elected ALP leader surety of tenure - looks like Labor can't get rid of Bill in a hurry unless the 'rules' are changed again. ,48,TimOfAltona
5452,Labor need to stop parachuting union hacks into the senate - union officials see the senate as a reward for their services to the union movement and the factions make sure they get in irrespective of their suitability for a senate role. ,43,TimOfAltona
5453,I hear your frustration - what your argument lacks is a suggestion who the leader should be if not Shorten - the leader will be from within a small group of well known Labor front bench luminaries - unless you can offer up a  alternative to Shorten he will remain leader.,52,TimOfAltona
5454,Clearly Bill has been reading my posts and taken in the comments of the past few months - note to the Labor cheer squad who get all nasty &amp; unhinged when I post my opinion on Labor's future - your very own leader echos my views.,46,TimOfAltona
5455,Ahhh...so that explains perfectly why the Greens have 1 rep in a 150 seat lower house - and he is only there because of the Liberals - 99% of Australians are dumb and don't understand science or economics.,38,TimOfAltona
5456,Ahhh..don't you just love the delusional world of the Gillard support camp - it seems a handful of them still exist- emerging from the shadows (anonymously of course) to vainly attempt the resurrection of the failed McTernan created and scripted 'misogyny' tactic. ,43,TimOfAltona
5457,It's a shame these PUP Senators don't have a say in anything - they simply follow Clive's 'behind closed doors' direction and that means Clive will only support policies/legislation that benefits him personally. ,34,TimOfAltona
5458,I think it's widely acknowledged now that the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd years almost wiped Labor off the political map - attacking the Murdoch or any other press that highlighted Labor's inadequacies is purely 'shooting the messenger'.,34,TimOfAltona
5459,"The reality is, it makes no difference what he says or does not say, he could have given the utmost eloquent and heartwarming statement about Wran's passing and the Labor/Ggreens cheer squad would still rip into him with confected anger and outrage - it's what they do day in day out. ",52,TimOfAltona
5460,"RDorkins - your statement that ""the recently deceased Labor premier of NSW who attracted not an ounce of scandal during his more than a decade as leader"" needs to be retracted - it is just not true - perhaps you are blinded by your failure to see anything wrong with the Labor party? ",54,TimOfAltona
5461,They can't bear to think that Australia might actually find the plane on behalf of the relatives and that the Australian government could look good coming out of all this. ,31,TimOfAltona
5462,"The thought of Australian PM Tony Abbott and the government being congratulated around the world sends them into a mad panic - they desperately want someone, anyone, else to find the plane first.",33,TimOfAltona
5463,They are free to leave any time they want - just as long as they don't go to Australia. Perhaps their time back in Indonesia was not so bad after all?,31,TimOfAltona
5464,"Two more years to go until the next election, if there are still some illegals in the sense of the term in the People Smuggling Protocol in detention and your side wins, you can let them out.",37,TimOfAltona
5465,C'mon Andi we've been over this time and time again - these people arrived in Australian waters in illegal people smuggling boats and are therefore correctly termed 'illegals' - you know that. ,33,TimOfAltona
5466,Pal - just scroll down the pages in this thread and every other article on this matter and it's soon very evident who is playing politics over this matter - ,31,TimOfAltona
5467,"Somehow you omitted from your list of inconvenient truths the 1000+ men, women and children who have drowned thanks to Labor dismantling Howard's border protection policies that saw all the offshore detention camps closed because the people smugglers were put out of business. ",44,TimOfAltona
5468,Good to see the Coalition's tough approach to border protection has saved countless numbers from drowning and is returning our generous UNHCR intake program to a fair and orderly process.,30,TimOfAltona
5469,Murder? If you were there and saw for yourself what happened perhaps you should contact the inquiry and tell them what you saw. As a first hand witness your statement could be invaluable at determining the outcome?,37,TimOfAltona
5470,"The hapless Rudd thought he was onto a winner when he dismantled the Howard era policies that had all but eliminated people smuggling activity, no doubt spurred along by Sarah Hanson-Young ",32,TimOfAltona
5471,How many hapless souls drowned at sea as a direct result of Labor's initiative? We'll probably never really know the exact figure but it sits somewhere between one and two thousand. ,32,TimOfAltona
5472,"Should there be an inquiry (outside the official PNG police investigation) into  person who unfortunately lost his life in PNG? Yes, according to the ALP/Greens cheer squad because this death occurred when a Coalition government is in power and it provides them a perfect platform to launch (often confected) attacks against the government - irrespective of the outcome.  ",61,TimOfAltona
5473,I've noticed in the Guardian threads a whole heap of Labor supporters attempting to link Tony Abbott to Adolf Hitler and one regular Labor contributor is even trying to link him to Pol Pot. ,35,TimOfAltona
5474,It's as if they can't get enough of him - there is a good movie that may satisfy their insatiable appetite for all things Nazi Germany - it is called Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will) a 1935 movie by Leni Riefenstahl which chronicals the 1934 Nazi Party congress at Nuremburg. This movie is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest propaganda movies of all time and has plenty of shots of Adolf - enough to keep even the most avid Labor/Greens cheer squadder enthralled- here's the You Tube link for those interested - ,96,TimOfAltona
5475,Why would anyone want to go to something like this - a handful of extreme left Labor/Greens radicals with a sprinkling of GetUp stirrers trying to whip up anti-government sentiment. ,31,TimOfAltona
5476,I understand GetUp play an important role in these types of events - they have people back at their offices busily photoshopping images from the event so that the 20 or so people that actually turn up are transformed into 200+ in the pictures they feed through to the media. ,51,TimOfAltona
5477,1. You and the ALP would still be in government today2. The in-coming government would not have to be making tough decisions and taking unpopular actions to fix up Labor's fiscal mess. ,33,TimOfAltona
5478,Fair to say that history repeats itself over and over again - Liberal Party manages the economy well and builds up the nation's wealth - Labor party comes in and blows all our money and plunges the country into unsustainable debt which leads to them being tossed out of office and the Libs return to fix it all up again - and so it goes on. ,67,TimOfAltona
5479,"I think successive polls over the years have always reflected the view that Labor's strength lies in it's social services agenda but it is  at managing our finances, where as the Libs are considered the better guardians of our finances. ",42,TimOfAltona
5480,The audit commission seems to have made some sobering recommendations which won't be popular with everyone - bottom line is had Labor not blown the massive surplus it was gifted when Rudd came into power we would not be in this situation. ,43,TimOfAltona
5481,"Perhaps Sweden have gone about it in the right way with their assimilation programs, but already it is causing problems and can quickly get out of hand if migrants arrive en masse - housing, health, education, employment are the hallmarks of a successful migrant intake program - but it must be regulated and controlled.",54,TimOfAltona
5482,I suspect a big part of Labor's problems are illustrated by your comment - you seem to think that by grubby personal abuse hurled at senior Coalition figures somehow that will transition into Labor winning the next election. ,39,TimOfAltona
5483,Or is it perhaps you accept Labor have zero chance of getting back into government for another 2 to 3 terms so all you have left is to hurl abuse?. ,31,TimOfAltona
5484,Perhaps you don't understand or just plain did not know - Scott Morrison when the riot occurred - he was back in Australia at the time and did not see for himself the events that unfolded. ,37,TimOfAltona
5485,"This then means that he has to rely on advice from others who were on the ground. He can only relay what he has been told and one assumes, as Minister, he receives information from more than one source.  ",41,TimOfAltona
5486,Looking at which way a fence is leaning means jack shit - it could have been pulled that way after the event - anything could have happened or caused it.. Without actual reliable eyewitness accounts we may never know.,39,TimOfAltona
5487,"In time Manus and Nauru will be closed down, with all the genuine asylum seekers resettled in countries other than Australia. Some will eventually be granted settlement in Australia via the orderly UNHCR intake. To do this they come through the FRONT door, not the back door via people smuggling boats. ",52,TimOfAltona
5488,"All the off shore detention centres were closed down during the Howard years - the same will happen in the second or third term of the coalition government, then you'll have nothing more to bitch and moan about..",38,TimOfAltona
5489,"The Barati death was a tragedy and should never have happened, a view firmly held by Immigration Minister Morrison. Things clearly got out of control on Manus and we are all now much wiser with hindsight and no doubt with several inquiries underway, the security of transferees on Manus will be significantly enhanced. ",54,TimOfAltona
5490,How many lives has this government saved as result- hundreds?? - we will never know but even if ONE life has been saved by shutting down the people smugglers then it has been worthwhile. ,35,TimOfAltona
5491,"We all eagerly await the 4 Corners investigation into the Rudd government kick starting the Indonesian people smuggling industry which lead to the deaths of 1000+ men, women and children at sea.  ",34,TimOfAltona
5492,"As we have with Mr Barati, let's start giving these 1000+ men, women and children an identity - you know, names, ages, backgrounds, aspirations, interview with friends and families and what it was about the ALP's 2007 policy that encouraged/tempted them to get into leaky people smuggling boats and try to make it to Australia? ",56,TimOfAltona
5493,In 2016 you and evry other Australian will have every opportunity to judge this governments actions in shutting down the people smuggler trade - something Labor were found wanting with. ,31,TimOfAltona
5494,"So,let me get this straight - a future  looking for pre-selection goes public with untested and unverified allegations designed to damage the Coalition and all the Labor/Greens cheer squad whip themselves up into a frenzy like sharks at feeding time. ",42,TimOfAltona
5495,These people come from the left side of politics in Australia. The left were soundly beaten in last years federal election so they are using the MH370 tragedy to try and score cheap political points against the Australian government. ,40,TimOfAltona
5496,Good news for the asylum seekers. They knew they would not be resettled in Australia if they came here in people smuggler boats instead of going through the orderly UNHCR program so this is a not unreasonable outcome for them.,40,TimOfAltona
5497,"The 1000+ asylum seekers who drowned following Rudd's dismantling of Howards border protection policies only have themselves to blame because noone forced them onto the boats, yet the Coalition are totally to blame for the death of 1 person in the Manus Island detention centre during a riot.",48,TimOfAltona
5498,Poor ol Chippendale - about the only person left in Australia who still worships the ground Gillard walks on - has not accepted that Labor were crushed in the last election - just  seats is it they hold in a 150 seat parliament? ,45,TimOfAltona
5499,"Let's all get back to reality here - Labor are out of government for many many years to come - Labor simply are unable to present themselves as a viable alternative government for all the reasons we know so Chippendale may as well hop over to the good side and start supporting this government as it goes about the business of securing Australia's future - and yes, that Chippendale and his family.",72,TimOfAltona
5500,You gotta laugh - so desperate are Labor supporters who can see their own party sinking so fast they want to engage with the Nats to try and keep Labor afloat - they tried with the Greens and it all turned to crap.  ,45,TimOfAltona
5501,There has been a shortage of boats arriving in the post few months - the Labor/Greens cheer squad can't stand that thought - it is vital for them and their anti-government campaign that the boats keep arriving.  ,39,TimOfAltona
5502,"The people smugglers desperately want to see Labor get back into governmemt, preferably with the Greens helping them to form government - this is their green light to start up their insidious trade again.",34,TimOfAltona
5503,Thanks for confirming the Labor/Greens cheer squad want to see the people smugglers succeed - after all if they do prosper it gives you the opportunity to say the Coalition have failed. ,33,TimOfAltona
5504,Bizarre that the Labor/Greens cheer squad want to be so subservient to Indonesia - it's like they regard Indonesia is some kind of supreme overlord that we must bow and scrape to. ,33,TimOfAltona
5505,"Newsflash: This is no longer the dysfunctional government of a giggling, inept and scripted Julia Gillard - this is a government that is taking a stand for Australia's interests and won't be dictated to by Indonesian people smugglers aided by corrupt Indonesian officials.",43,TimOfAltona
5506,No amount of kicking and screaming fom leftwing losers in these threads changes the fact that this government has achieved something the dysfunctional Labor/Greens government was never able to do. ,31,TimOfAltona
5507,"It looks like the Labor/Greens cheer squad have completely overlooked the fact that apart from the Labor government opening up our borders in 2007 and starting up the Indonesia people smuggling business again, which lead to the current mess, it is also Indonesian apathy and corruption that allowed the people smuggling business to flourish. ",55,TimOfAltona
5508,It is real shame for this country that the hapless Gillard and incompetent Swan were able to form a minority government 3.5 years ago - it meant we had another 3 years of Labor's greatest achievement - record debt and deficit. ,42,TimOfAltona
5509,The Commission of Audit are telling it how it is - Labor wear significant responsibility for we are at and as in previous decades it will take a Coalition government to fix it all up again. ,37,TimOfAltona
5510,"I'll scour your history to read your comments calling for the resignation of the conga line of Labor Immigration Minister's under whose watch 1000+men, women and children drowned at sea.",30,TimOfAltona
5511,With the Coalition now in government and fixing up the Labor/Greens mess the offshore processing centres will eventually be emptied out as genuine asylum seekers are resettled in countries other than Australia and the non-genuine ones are returned to their country of birth. ,44,TimOfAltona
5512,"This is great news - the people smugglers have been shut down, people are no longer drowning in their hundreds or thousands and the offshore processing centres will be closed down. ",32,TimOfAltona
5513,I don't follow your argument - are you saying the perperators of Mr Barati's death are other asylum seekers and the asylum seekers claiming to be 'eye witnesses' are in danger from them? ,34,TimOfAltona
5514,These people will say anything in order to get to Australia - no doubt coached by the pro bonos who reckon they know all the loop holes. If they are sent to Australia from Manus another 30 will suddenly be 'eyewitnessess' seeking protection. ,44,TimOfAltona
5515,I understand Labor have a surplus of heavy duty shredders they brought in when they lost government - they were being used 24/7 2 or 3 weeks  the election.,30,TimOfAltona
5516,"Get over it - this has been part of the fabric of Australian politics for decades. Labor were doing it and lord knows the Greens would be doing it too, except noone would pay to hear Christine Milne speak - the Greens would have to pay people to turn up.",50,TimOfAltona
5517,I knew you guys would not let me down - while you are at it can you please let Chippendale know that the asylum seekers headed to Cambodia are not being sent into the clutches of Pol Pot as he was asserting the other week.,45,TimOfAltona
5518,"Labor thought they had the Greens locked safely away in the marital bedroom only to discover the Greens had broken open their chastity belt, climbed out the window and had a fling with someone else. ",36,TimOfAltona
5519,Deep down both parties know that united they survive but divided they perish so they have booked themselves into the local office of Gillard and Brown Marriage Counselling Services for expert advice. ,33,TimOfAltona
5520,"The Greens with their seat count of 1 will find it somewhat challenging to form government - even then, Bandt is only in parliament because the Libs put him there with preferences. ",33,TimOfAltona
5521,Times may be changing but I think we may be looking sometime into the next century before the Greens may have enough seats to form government in this country - my prediction is never.,34,TimOfAltona
5522,It seems Chippendale is the only person in Australia who thinks Gillard would have lead Labor to a rousing victory if she had not been thrown out by Shorten and Rudd.,31,TimOfAltona
5523,"The thing about Gillard you continually 'overlook' is that had she stayed on as Labor leader, the ALP would be lucky to have 30 seats in the 150 seat parliament such was the nations loathing and contempt for the woman. ",41,TimOfAltona
5524,"The Greens always said they would support it providing the threshold was reduced and Labor, well Labor just thrashed around talking about themselves and squabbling amongst each other in their usual dysfunctional state. ",34,TimOfAltona
5525,If the reality for Abbott is that he needs to compromise on the threshold to pass it through the senate then so be it. It will still be a massive win for him and will be welcomed by working mothers around the country who qualify - which is most of them.,51,TimOfAltona
5526,Ross makes some valid points but I think the millions of dollars of Australian aid (Australian taxpayer dollars) should not be seen as irrelevant to the equation - also there is the elephant in the room over the 'small' issue of West Papua. ,44,TimOfAltona
5527,"Yes, Indonesia is a vast archipelago but make no mistake, every boat that leaves has been assisted in some part by someone in authority in the local area, either directly or by turning a blind eye in return for payment. ",41,TimOfAltona
5528,Indonesia needs to take on more of the heavy lifting to shut down the people smugglers - leaving it all up to Australia are not the actions of a good neighbour. ,32,TimOfAltona
5529,"The end game here was to shut down the people smugglers by denying them a product to sell. It's clearly cutting through, so instead of thousands arriving by boat each week under Labor accompanied by 1000+ drownings, we are almost down to zero people smuggler boats laden with human cargo departing Indonesia. ",53,TimOfAltona
5530,"Rank and file members of the Labor party are not the problem nor can they influence change, it is the union factions that hold the real power and this is why we see Bill Shorten as ALP leader and the failed Gillard experiment earlier. ",45,TimOfAltona
5531,Shorten needs desperately to reform his party if Labor are to have any hope in forming a government in the next 6-9 years - can he do it and weaken the union power base?  ,36,TimOfAltona
5532,He does make a good point re putting them to work to assist the PNG economy whilst they are awaiting processing. Not sure the left would support that proposal - I can hear the cries of 'slave labour' already.  ,41,TimOfAltona
5533,I recall that PNG is the largest recipient of Australian taxpayer dollars - without Australian aid PNG would be almost a basket case - could this be a classic case of biting the hand that feeds you?,37,TimOfAltona
5534,Perhaps Turnbull will be our next PM one day - he would be certain to keep Labor out of government for an extended period. He is gaining support with his Communications portfolio it seems -,35,TimOfAltona
5535,Turnbull was always going to replace Abbott as PM one day - it's all a matter of the timing - it may happen in the second or perhaps the third term. ,32,TimOfAltona
5536,"People don't usually comment on poll results unless their side that has the favorable result - if their side is behind in any given poll, they tend to go quiet, look the other way &amp; pretend it is not there (unless their only comment is to say the polls are rigged) . We saw this with the polling leading up to last years federal election. ",66,TimOfAltona
5537,Bottom line here is these poll results were to be expected in the lead up to what was always going to be a tough first budget for the incoming government. ,31,TimOfAltona
5538,There are still 2.5 years to go before the next election - an eternity in politics and plenty of time to assess whether the Coalition's budget measures are working for the economy. ,33,TimOfAltona
5539,"Remodelling the GST is only a matter of time away - it will take a poltically brave government to legislate changes, but it will happen one day - the NZ National Government (Conservative) raised the GST across the ditch and the country is still standing , in fact they are in a better fiscal position based on per head of population than Australia.",63,TimOfAltona
5540,"David, don't know if you happened to see Q&amp;A on the ABC last Monday night - but I reckon that particular group of panelists were the best we've seen for months - highly intelligent, articulate and passionate for their causes.  ",42,TimOfAltona
5541,If they could only sit in a room and thrash out a map/plan for Australia's future we could do a lot worse - the best of Labor's social policies coupled with the best of the Coalition's fiscal good management. Turnbull was on the panel - he will make a great PM one day.,53,TimOfAltona
5542,"Don't know if you happened to see Q&amp;A on the ABC last Monday night - but I reckon that particular group of panelists were the best we've seen for months - highly intelligent, articulate and passionate for their causes.  ",41,TimOfAltona
5543,If they could only sit in a room and thrash out a map/plan for Australia's future we could do a lot worse - the best of Labor's social policies coupled with the best of the Coalition's fiscal good management. ,40,TimOfAltona
5544,The Coalition are on the right track - they will embrace/adopt some of the Audit Commission's report - the key thing here is that something is being done to repair Labor's debt and deficit. ,35,TimOfAltona
5545,The government would not be too concerned and be too concerned re polling results a) before the budget and b) this far out from an election - with over 2 years to go. ,34,TimOfAltona
5546,Hate to be the bearer of bad news cheer squadders - 2.5 years is an eternity in politics - Labor and the Greens have no hope in hell of forming another government in 2016.  ,36,TimOfAltona
5547,"Hang on, petrol excise was originally a Labor policy abolished by Howard to help him save the election for the Coalition and ever since the government of the day has missed out on billions of dollars in tax revenues. ",40,TimOfAltona
5548,Now for the GST - when will we see that increased to 12% (where it probably should be). That would solve a heap fiscal problems for this and successivegovernments - NZ went down that path and their economy is powering along.,41,TimOfAltona
5549,"Fact remains, Abbott is the preferred PM over Shorten and the government will prevail at the next election - next weeks tough budget will be but a distant memory in 2016. Loooooong way to go and plenty of time for the government to get back on top - and they will.",51,TimOfAltona
5550,Clearly Abbott and his Cabinet have some tough decisions to make on how to extract Australia from it's current debt and deficit problems and how to lay the foundations for structural change to benefit the nation over the next couple of decades. ,43,TimOfAltona
5551,"I doubt Labor will stand in the way too much with the upcoming budget measures, after all, our money dried up under their watch and we were left running the country on overseas borrowings.",34,TimOfAltona
5552,I very much doubt the Nigerian government  to see hundreds massacred in that village two days ago nor  to see 300 school girls kidnapped and subjected to unspeakable horrors - I suggest the Nigerian government has pretty much lost control of the situation and international assistance is needed to prevent ongoing atrocities against innocent people.,57,TimOfAltona
5553,"No one should underestimate Tony Abbott. He is arguably one of the most successful politicians this country has seen - how many Labor PM's did he see off in opposition and then go on to win,reducing Labor to a rump of it's former self in the Lower House. ",49,TimOfAltona
5554,But the people have dictated our policies - they democratically elected a Coaltion government to 'Stop the Boats' and that is exactly what the this government is going about doing - the nation asked for it. ,37,TimOfAltona
5555,If the nation wants to start up the boats again then all they need to do is vote in a Labor/Greens government in 2016 and hey presto! your people smugglers will be back in business.,35,TimOfAltona
5556,"As much as you want to see the people smugglers dictate who comes to Australia and when, the reality is we now have a government with the resolve to shut them down. ",33,TimOfAltona
5557,The left have well and truly lost the battle on this one - there is no overwhelming support amongst Australians to reopen our borders to all who can make it here by people smuggler boats. ,36,TimOfAltona
5558,"Bruce appears to favour unrestricted migration by anyone claiming refugee status. How many detention centres does he think Australia will need to accommodate the tens of thousands who will be incentivised to attempt the journey via people smuggler boats? 10, 50, 100, 500? ",44,TimOfAltona
5559,Perhaps he is on the same ticket as Sarah Hanson-Young who wants zero detention/processing centres and everyone who comes here be released straight into the community while their claims are processed? ,32,TimOfAltona
5560,Where are these people going to live? They cannot work so they can only survive on Centrelink handouts which means they are surviving below the poverty line. The charity organsiations would go into melt down unable to cope with the demand. ,42,TimOfAltona
5561,"Hundreds of thousands of genuine refugees have been welcomed into Australia through an orderly and regulated UNHCR program - they have been afforded housing, jobs, health care, education and most have assimilated well into their local communities and taken up Australian citizenship.  ",44,TimOfAltona
5562,It is the disorderly and unrestricted entry that the Abbott government is dealing with by following through on a policy it took to the last election - stopping the boats and shutting down the people smugglers - I cannot understand why so many on the left argue that is a bad policy and want to see the government fail in it's efforts to control our borders.,66,TimOfAltona
5563,Don't think the boys and girls down at Australian Customs or the immigration boys and girls manning the airport departure/arrivals would appreciate being compared to events 80 years ago in Germany? ,32,TimOfAltona
5564,"I am not having a go at her, she has been wheeled in by Shorten as a door stop prop to try and resurrect his increasing irrelevance to Labor's message. ",31,TimOfAltona
5565,They had better cast their eyes to another thread that says something along the lines about labor changing their offshore processing policy to processing onshore and the resultant start up of the people smuggling operations again. ,37,TimOfAltona
5566,There is no 'unfolding disaster' - the primary aim is to get these people processed and get them out of there - in time the processing centres will be closed down as they were previously. ,36,TimOfAltona
5567,The 'unfolding disaster' occurred under Labor when 1000's of people were drowning because there was no deterrent in place to discourage people getting on leaky boats and trying to reach Australia - now  was an unfolding disaster of the highest magnitude.,42,TimOfAltona
5568,These people boarded boats in Indonesia in full knowledge they would not be able to enter Australia and would end up in Manus or Nauru - which is where they now are. ,33,TimOfAltona
5569,The primary objective should now be to clear those processing centres out and shut them down. With the boats all but stopped they will no longer be needed in the future (Howard successfully closed them down until Labor reopened them). ,41,TimOfAltona
5570,"The government should fast track processing and provide these people with 4 options - start a new life in the country they are in (PNG or Nauru) and assimilate with the local community, relocate and settle in a third country which is accepting of their refugee status, return to Indonesia or return to their own country if it is safe to do so or they are economic migrants. ",69,TimOfAltona
5571,That's the point - the election is 2.5 years away - todays polls are meaningless - the government is only just starting out - over 2 years to deliver on the structural reform necessary.,34,TimOfAltona
5572,What many in the Labor/Greens camp don't like to face up to is that Labor  for most of 2013 - nothing could have saved them from defeat - it was only a matter of by how many seats (as it turned out Labor salvaged 55 seats with Rudd and it would have been 30 seats with Gillard) - ,60,TimOfAltona
5573,"This was nothing to do with the media, Tony Abbott or Rupert Murdoch - it was all about Labor in a very public war with itself, factions brawling, white-anting, unresolved leadership turmoil, some very bad judgment calls by Gillard and hideous micro-management by Rudd. ",45,TimOfAltona
5574,"Labor's problem for the next 10 years or so is that they will need that long to rebuild, sort out what kind of party they want to be, who their leadership team will be and break away from union domination. ",41,TimOfAltona

If Labor is not in government it matters not who the Coalition have as PM, their mission in life is to attack and tear that individual down by any means possible - so whether it's Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull or  leading the Libs that individual will be relentlessly attacked and vilified irrespective of how good a job they are doing. Group A account for roughly 95% of the regular commentators here as the Guardian have provided them a meeting place to 'hang out' and support each others' ideology. ",109,TimOfAltona
5580,"Group B - People who comment more objectively, they lean towards Labor but from time to time actually agree with something the Coalition are doing and are not afraid to express their view knowing full well they will be shot down in flames by Group A. Group B account for roughly 2% of the commentators. ",56,TimOfAltona
5581,Group C - People who lean towards the LNP and comment on here with an alternate view knowing that 100% guaranteed they will be attacked and vilified by Group A. Group C account for roughly 2% of the commentators (I wonder why?) ,43,TimOfAltona
5582,"Group D - People who claim they used to vote for the Liberal Party and also voted for Tony Abbott but have now 'switched' to Labor. Group D pleases Group A very much but Group C are a little suspicious. Group D accounts for........well Jim, that's just you on your own it seems.",53,TimOfAltona
5583,The policy shows how skewed the Labor governments priorities are. In 2006 Howard introduced similar cuts as part of his welfare to work scheme. At the time Labor opposed the cuts because they left single mothers worse off without offering any improvement to employment opportunities. But in government Labor failed to reverse these cutsand are now implementing an even harsher policy. ,62,TimOfAltona

5618,So the 'age of entitlement' is alive and well in the Labor/Greens cheer squad I see - this is why we are in the massive debt hole we are today - paying millions of dollars a day just to cover the interest on overseas borrowings to cover government handouts. ,50,TimOfAltona

5627,Scroll down and read plenty of comments from people attacking George Christensen's physical appearance - in my view this amounts to on-line bullying perpetrated by cowards hiding behind a veil anonymity. ,32,TimOfAltona

5644,The problem with your argument is that Coalition MP's were not the ones climbing all over their seats and carrying on like heckling baboons at feeding time at the zoo. This is why so many Labor MP's have been ejected. They need to learn a little restraint during QT.,49,TimOfAltona

5646,A DD election is held and the Coalition are returned (which is what would be expected) given the ALP/Greens are in no fit state to govern the country and Abbott then has a definite mandate to push through his fiscal reform measures - Labor are left reeling and clamouring for Shorten's head on a stick and the Coalition are in power for another 2-3 terms. ,66,TimOfAltona

5649,"Just pointing out that Labor have form when it comes to releasing costed policies less than a day before polls open - I expect Shorten is going to try and stall for the next 2.5 years and hope that rhetoric and banging out a few bars of ""Solidarity Forever' will keep people happy until then.",55,TimOfAltona
5650,Labor created the problem - so it's only fair that they tell us how they will fix it if they were in government - unless you just blindly accept that anything Labor may do will be for the good of the nation.,42,TimOfAltona
5651,Your point is valid - however in this case there is a difference - it was Labor that created the unsustainable debt and deficit that the present government is trying to fix up. ,34,TimOfAltona
5652,"If Labor, as the architects of our debt and deficit, can only criticize the government's efforts to clean it up without putting forward an alternate plan then they start to look, well, disingenuous.",33,TimOfAltona
5653,"C'mon, we all know Labor are an empty vessel when it comes to how they would approach the Budget ""Task"" (Shorten's terminology for Labor's deficit) - apart from smoke and mirrors rhetoric he has nothing, nothing to offer apart from bagging other peoples ideas. ",45,TimOfAltona
5654,Sooner or later his credibility will be on the line if he keeps avoiding the question on what Labor would do - I think we all know the answer - further debt and deficit.,34,TimOfAltona

5657,"Around election time it's traditional for newspapers to throw their support behind one side or the other - in 2007 Rupert backed Kevin Rudd but when News turned against Labor during the unfolding Rudd/Gillard/Rudd disaster all the Labor supporters went feral, preferring to blame the media rather than look at the inherent problems within their own side - problems which still exist today.",63,TimOfAltona
5658,My theory is their tactic is to deliberately bait the Speaker so she is forced to eject them - it's as if they are daring her to eject them - they are reminiscent of the hyenas out of The Lion King - put on a brave face but ultimately are cowards. ,52,TimOfAltona
5659,So it appears it will not only be the Indonesian people smugglers hoping and praying Labor get back in 2016 - dole bludgers will also be hoping for a Labor return.,31,TimOfAltona

5661,There is only so much money to go around - you gotta remember that Labor spent all the nation's money/savings during their 6 years of dysfunction and deceit - the government have to sort out the mess as best they can. ,42,TimOfAltona
5662,We wait with bated breath to hear how Labor propose to sort out the Budget 'Task' - the problem is all we will hear is rhetoric for the next 2.5 years while Shorten struggles to hold onto his leadership and we won't get to see Labor's 'fully costed' policies until a few hours before the polls open in 2016.,59,TimOfAltona
5663,This has been the pattern of behaviour from them since the new government came into power...time to reflect and accept they will be on the opposition benches for at least 2 more terms so time to settle down and start acting like adult representatives of their constituencies.  ,49,TimOfAltona

5666,"Here's a little tip for the Labor/Greens cheer squad - volcanoes, earthquakes, tidal waves and the like have nothing to do with climate change - the usual suspects are already blaming the Indonesian volcano and ash cloud on Tony Abbott's climate policy. ",43,TimOfAltona

5671,"Palmer will only stay in Parliament until he gets bored or has decided it is no longer useful to his business interests, then PUP disappears from our political scene forever. ",31,TimOfAltona
5672,Why not just merge the two operations - significant cost savings can be achieved without compromising quality or content whilst providing a better return for the tax payer. Maintain separate channels and keep ABC ad free with SBS operating with commercials as now. ,44,TimOfAltona
5673,This is what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you - perhaps the Refugee Council should not have been so critical of the governments efforts to shut down the people smugglers.,33,TimOfAltona
5674,Offshore processing centres are here to stay until the current asylum seekers who arrived via people smugglers are processed and resettled in countries other than Australia - Labor and the Coalition are on a unity ticket on this. ,39,TimOfAltona
5675,"With the boat arrivals all but stopped, there are no new transferees heading to Nauru or Manus - this is a good thing and shows the government's tough border control policies are working - this is what we voted for. ",41,TimOfAltona
5676,Conditons are not ideal in the processing centres - this Feb report highlights there are things that need to be done to improve conditions - it is up to the government to implement and ensure the well being of the asylum seekers.,42,TimOfAltona
5677,I was neither cheering on or saying fairs fair when comments were made about Gillard's appearance. Her physical appearance had no bearing on her faults as a politician and the latter is where people should direct their comments/opinions - not cowardly and offensive anonymous remarks about peoples' appearance. ,49,TimOfAltona
5678,Lately there has been a surge in these types of attacks against Liberal politicians from presumably Labor supporters -.at what point does the right to free speech/opinion cross over into what constitutes on-line cowardly bullying aimed at a persons appearance? ,41,TimOfAltona
5679,I don't accuse all Labor supporters of engaging in this - but there are a large number operating in these threads who cowardly prey on the physical apperance of others to try and score 'points'. ,36,TimOfAltona
5680,"The bigger story here is that a Labor government were applying an up front fee for Uni students of $250 in 1987, whch with inflation would be around $600 in todays money. ",33,TimOfAltona
5681,Let me tell you something - if Turnbull and Palmer wanted a 'secret' meeting it would not have been in a public restaurant resplendant with media photographers and restaurant owners telling us what they ate for entrees.,37,TimOfAltona
5682,Labor and the Greens have been propping each other up for survival for years now - you merely confirm what we all ready know - Labor and the Greens are but one when it comes to the crunch. ,39,TimOfAltona
5683,Palmer is clearly using the Australian political system as his own pet plaything - he has the wealth to sustain such a folly which is beyond the realm and imagination of ordinary Australians. ,34,TimOfAltona
5684,"Funny how a Guardian piece that actually tells it like it is - in this case Wayne Swan's foibles, it catches the Labor supporters off guard and knocks them for six.  ",33,TimOfAltona
5685,"Newspoll is not kind to the government today and all the Labor supporters are singing it's praises - but hang on, this is a  poll, you know, the one that is totally rigged by Rupert when it reflects favourably on the government and should be totally disregarded as Murdoch propaganda propping up the Abbott government according to the Labor/Greens cheer squad. ",63,TimOfAltona
5686,Yet somehow today they have found the strength to forgive Rupert and find a new found confidence that Newspoll is actually a very good reflection of how people regard the government - at least until Newspoll turns around and shows the government is back in front and Labor behind - then Newspoll will be totally rigged once more. ,59,TimOfAltona
5687,Australia has implemented tough border control policies which include turning people smuggling boats around and sending them back to Indonesia and if any asylum seekers make it to Australia they are immediately sent to offshore processing centres in Papua New Guinea and Nauru - never to be settled in Australia. ,51,TimOfAltona
5688,The Australian government has broken the people smuggling business model which means an orderly and generous UNHCR program prevails in Australia with thousands of asylum seekers applying for and receiving protection through the front door and not the back door via people smugglers.,43,TimOfAltona
5689,Q&amp;A should make good viewing tonight - Lucy Turnbull is a star and one of the nicest people you could meet - a worthy addition to the panel.  ,30,TimOfAltona

5691,"Labor like to create a little mischief over this and their cheer squad all hop on board and give it a run - gosh it's not like Labor don't have experience or anything when it comes to leadership speculation, we've just gone through 6 years of almost daily speculation  they still have the Bill Shorten/Albo debacle to sort out. ",61,TimOfAltona
5692,"Not sure you can deduce 'heading for a Labor landslide' - still 2.5 years to go - that's hundreds of polls away - as you well know polls have a habit of changing direction - it's only a matter of time before they start being favorable to the government - could be a few months away, but it will happen.",60,TimOfAltona
5693,"Hang on - this person was living in the community, was being supported by a case worker (with whom he had seen only the day before) and by all accounts was going to be granted asylum. He suffered from depression. Depression claims the lives of thousands of Australians each year. ",51,TimOfAltona
5694,No matter how many hundreds of times you type 'Election Now' it actually won't achieve an early election - you/we still all have to wait for another 2.5 years when the next federal election will be held. ,38,TimOfAltona
5695,The irony of this early election call by the Labor/Greens cheer squad is that the Abbott government is likely to be returned - people won't trust another Labor/Greens government so soon after the last debacle.,35,TimOfAltona
5696,"Nothing has happened since Sept to suggest that Labor have remedied any of that - to the contrary, they are still racked by division, uncertainty and lack of purpose/direction. ",30,TimOfAltona
5697,"It was always going to take 2 or 3 terms in opposition to rebuild, find a leader that can take them forward and try and make a fist of government without relying on the Greens to get them over the line.",41,TimOfAltona
5698,Herein lies Labor's problem - you just don't know what they stand for any more - even die hard Labor supporters are confused. The various factions are still at war with each other and Shorten is struggling big time to gain traction whilst fending off the Albanese push (or should that be putsch?) ,54,TimOfAltona
5699,"In my opinion, it's only a matter of time before the polls swing back in favor of the government and Labor will be left behind once again desperately searching for leadership, purpose and direction.",34,TimOfAltona
5700,"Australia  will be a Republic........sits on the same 'To Do' list as a common currency with NZ, a second airport for Sydney and Labor and the Greens 'coming out of the closet' and formalising their union.",37,TimOfAltona
5701,This is all a temporary diversion and will soon blow over and Shaw will be gone - let's get back to the main game - the Nov election and let no one forget why Labor lost the last Victorian election - same as their federal counterparts it was all over fiscal incompetence and saddling the state and tax payers with massive debt via their multi-bilion dollar desalination plant white elephant. ,71,TimOfAltona
5702,"NZ have also just announced announced a budget surplus, the economy is going gang busters (on the back of the dairy industry and rebuilding of Christchurch) and with the ecnomy in such good shape many NZ'rs are heading home to live and work from around the world. ",48,TimOfAltona
5703,"Don't know why they keep banging on about it - the governments border protection policy is working, the boats have stopped arriving, the drownings at sea have ceased and we are returning to an orderly and  UNHCR asylum seeker migration program. ",43,TimOfAltona
5704,Labor and the Greens may have enjoyed/supported people smugglers dictating who comes into our country but this government is deciding who comes here and when and that is what we voted for and will vote for again in 2016.,39,TimOfAltona
5705,"Sounds like the Labor/Greens cheersquad won't rest until the doors to all asylum seeker processing centres are thrown open and the detainees free to roam the streets and try and etch out a living - problem is, how, with open maritime borders will we cope with the hundreds of thousands who will try and make their way to Australia by sea and also cope with the guilt of the thousands who will drown along the way? ",77,TimOfAltona
5706,Take a look at the Guardian story/thread on the unfolding disaster in Europe and wake up - if this is your vision for Australia then good luck getting back into government any time soon.,34,TimOfAltona
5707,You keep forgetting to mention that the Australian recording of SBY and his wife was done under a Rudd and then Gillard administration - I have yet to read a comment from a Labor/Greens supporter who actually acknowledge that - it's all too convenient to keep blaming Abbott for that and hope enough people believe it. ,57,TimOfAltona
5708,The Labor/Greens cheer squad are both perplexed and disappointed - having forensically examined the list of recipients looking for anyone or anything that has connections to the Abbott government they have come up with a big fat ZERO. ,39,TimOfAltona
5709,"They did find a former Labor minister though - don't see too many critical of that decision, in fact none. They found a Labor appointed Governer of NSW - don't see too many critical of that decision, in fact none. ",41,TimOfAltona
5710,You may be a bit confused...these people have already had their claims processed and they have been found to be not genuine refugees as per the UNHCR charter and have been awaiting deportation.  ,35,TimOfAltona
5711,"The two weeks is in relation to the data breach by the Immigration dept and allows the people affected to lodge a claim/argument as to why they should still not be returned to their country of origin. Given this issue has been swirling around for some months and all the pro-bono lawyers and refugee advocates have been very active , 2 weeks is plenty of time to submit a response.",70,TimOfAltona
5712,The government is providing them an opportunity to advise if the breach is likely to compromise a return to their country of origin - a fair and reasonable thing to do and each will be assessed on their merits.. ,40,TimOfAltona
5713,Not sure why the Labor/Greens cheer squad want to see these people stay in Australia - won't that encourage tens of thousands of unskilled economic refugees to make their way to Australia? ,33,TimOfAltona
5714,"There was a report that the victim was lying in the boat with his legs over the side &amp; dangling in the water - if true, that would explain how this tragedy occurred.",33,TimOfAltona
5715,"Yes, I'm sure that 70 years ago Churchill decided to invade Normandy knowing that in 70 years time the timing would be perfect to allow the PM of Australia to travel abroad to deflect criticism at home. Clever man that Winston Churchill. ",43,TimOfAltona
5716,She is the embarrassment - c'mon Labor when are you going to go into the second phase of your rebuilding and shed yourself of Shorten and Plibersek - before or after the 2016 election? ,35,TimOfAltona
5717,Correction - the Labor/Greens cheer squad are doing their very best at trying to keep that alive - you see it's the only thing they can pin on Malcolm and their fear he may one day be PM is starting to consume them.,43,TimOfAltona
5718,"Let's just accept Lucy's explanation that Malcolm went down to the local chinese for a bit of sweet and sour and happened to bump into Clive who was still hungry after the PM's dinner. Martin Parkinson was passing and spotted them through the window, went in, was invited to join them and shared a bit of Clive's peking duck. A passing journo spotted Clive's very distinctive Roller parked outside the restaurant, looked in through the window, spotted the three men taking turns spinning the Lazy Susan and decided to hang around outside to see what happens next and maybe take a few snaps. ",104,TimOfAltona
5719,"Fact the harsh cold reality pal - Gillard was toxic to both the Labor party and the country - in a way it's a shame Shorten and her own party knifed her before the election - had she stayed on, Labor would be lucky to have 30 seats in the Lower House today.",53,TimOfAltona
5720,Please share with us the links to Peta Credlin calling for an apology.  Please share with us the links that show that unelected staffers of politicians are fair game when it comes to deeply personal attacks.  Please explain why Clive Palmer can apolgise for his remarks yet you support his offensive remarks about Peta Credlin because you believe remarks were made about an elected politician Julia Gillard and this is some kind of tit for tat retribution?  Sad all round.  Thanks.,85,TimOfAltona
5721,Interesting comments on 7.30 tonight with Sarah Ferguson that the American administration are impressed by the way Abbott handled both China and Japan on his recent successful trip up there and also the fact he came away with some wins for Australia - diplomatically a difficult feat to achieve - something the US has had difficulty with for some time. ,61,TimOfAltona
5722,"Also, it seems the Canadian visit drew positive comments from the Canadian press and the US leg has had a good start in NY from a trade delegation perspective. ",30,TimOfAltona
5723,"Well, if it's good enough for Rudd and Gillard to visit, wine and dine with Murdoch in NY when they were PM, it's probably good enough for Abbott as well. ",31,TimOfAltona
5724,The Labor/Greens cheer squad have all conveniently overlooked the fact that all Australian PM's find their way to Ruperts door when they visit NY - even their beloved Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd.,33,TimOfAltona
5725,She placed herself in his hands and allowed herself to be scripted into the 'misogyny' tactic - McTernan thought this would be an angle to blunt Abbott's attack and keep Rudd at bay. ,34,TimOfAltona
5726,"Naturally it will be attacked by the Labor/Greens supporters, along with boat arrivals, fixing up the nation's (Labor's) debt and anything else Abbott went to the election with and is now delivering on. ",34,TimOfAltona
5727,"Any Australian PM, Labor or Liberal would be doing the same thing given the plane's reported proximity to Australia. Any Australian PM, Labor or Liberal would be expected to make comment on the progress of the search given Australia is leading it. The PM of the day would be expected to make comment based on the best advice from the multi-nation search experts. ",64,TimOfAltona
5728,I think it's time the Labor/Greens supporters stopped attacking Abbott for having the audacity to be the Australian PM when MH370 went missing and having the further audacity to report back on search progress from the experts. ,38,TimOfAltona
5729,"Alcohol is 'glamorized' in all Western countries yet is probably responsible for more than 50% of all road deaths, homicides, domestic violence, debilitating assaults and injuries and multiple forms of premature death costing western economies hundreds of billions of dollars each year. ",43,TimOfAltona
5730,"What little can be done lies in education from primary school onwards. Much the same as we all learned the terrible consequences of smoking tobacco, the same could work with demonstrating the detrimental effects of too much alcohol on our bodies, our families and friends and our lives in general. The message will sink in with some. ",58,TimOfAltona
5731,They underestimated him in the lead up to last year's election and look what happened - Labor were decimated and the cheer squad have been playing catchup ever since. ,30,TimOfAltona
5732,"In the mean time, Labor are still searching for legitimacy and purpose and are still a way off from resolving the factional wars and leadership debacles which have plagued them for years. Shorten and Plibersek are mere seat warmers, holding the fort until the next leadership team is installed. My considered guess will be Albanese as leader and Bowen or Burke as Deputy - more likely Bowen as Burke has a whiff of Eddie Obeid on him (ski lodge freebies and all that).",83,TimOfAltona
5733,"For some funny reason I get the impression that this will all boil down to how much dosh the government will need to hand over. I read somewhere that others are now lining up to claim the waste-land has spiritual significance for them as well...with all due respect to all concerned but this does smack of ""show me the compensation"". ",61,TimOfAltona
5734,"I travel regularly to the US and move in fairly wide circles over there - don't flatter yourself - Tony Abbott like all other Australian PM's before him, is largely unknown. Most of them couldn't name Australia's ""President"". ",39,TimOfAltona
5735,This I know - there are a few NYC police and US Gulf war veterans who have spent some time with him over the past couple of days and have come away with very positive opinions/impressions.,36,TimOfAltona
5736,"Newsflash - the average American wouldn't have a clue who Australia's PM is. Fair bet many of them would still, if asked, come up with John Howard as Australia's PM (due to his relatively high profile during the Bush years).  ",42,TimOfAltona
5737,If Ed believes Abbott is the talking point of America - then good on Abbott for having the highest profile of any Australian PM - can only do good for this country.,32,TimOfAltona
5738,"I'm actually way ahead in my predictions - unlike the Labor/Greens supporters who all predicted Abbott would lose last Sept election and also would never shut down the people smugglers operation, amongst others.",33,TimOfAltona
5739,I think you will find this issue is substantially deeper and more complex than your simplistic comment - Shorten has already offered Labor's bi-partisan support if the government elects to provide assistance to the US in Iraq. ,38,TimOfAltona
5740,"Perhaps, but the problem is Isis represents a major Islamic terrorist threat around the world - if they have a 'base' to operate from in Iraq, we can expect a surge in global terrorist attacks.",35,TimOfAltona
5741,"The budget will get through - it may not be in it's current form, but it will get through. Palmer is already signaling co-operation on carbon tax repeal and let's face it - he will always back the conservative side ahead of Labor/Greens.",43,TimOfAltona
5742,"So while Abbott is rubbing shoulders with Obama in Washington, back in camp ALP, Shorten is standing in a cold wet child care centre playground parroting the usual mantra ""Budget bad, Labor good"" with Kate Ellis standing behind him continuously nodding her head like some wooden puppet. ",48,TimOfAltona
5743,Oh dear - Labor do have a loooong way to go with their rebuilding program before they become relevant again and will be able to offer up a viable Labor/Greens alternative government - 2 or 3 terms away?,38,TimOfAltona
5744,If this is the best argument the Labor/Greens cheer squad can come up with then ROLL ON 2016 - only 2.5 years to go before the next Coalition government is sworn in.,32,TimOfAltona
5745,"You know as we all do that Abbott's visit has been termed successful - even Shorten had a good word for Abbott's North American visit this morning ""Promoting Australia's best interests overseas"". ",33,TimOfAltona
5746,Australia may provide logistical support for this. I would not support and can't see ground troops becoming involved - for exactly the same reasons the US won't want to put troops on the ground there.,35,TimOfAltona
5747,So it follows then that the Islamic world are also contemplating trade sanctions against Obama's USA and Cameron's United Kingdom and Key's NZ and Harper's Canada and Hollande's France and Merkel's Germany and Rutte's Netherlands and Tusk's Poland and Rajoy's Spain and Di Rupo's Belguim and Kenny's Ireland and so on and so - ,55,TimOfAltona
5748,The situation in Iraq does not bode well for any sort of peace in that region and also points to Australia being once more caught up in assisting other nations in theaters of war on the other side of the globe - you can see this going on for decades to come. ,53,TimOfAltona
5749,We can really only provide logistical support for any US intervention in Iraq - I think the last thing we need are Aussie ground troops getting involved for exactly the same reasons the US won't want to commit ground forces. ,41,TimOfAltona
5750, The US and it's allies can do an enormous amount of damage to Isis from the air - perhaps enough for Iraqi forces to regain territorial control - maybe.,30,TimOfAltona
5751,"So the much touted meeting with Obama went off without a hitch - all week I've been reading how Obama will 'take Abbott to task"" over climate change and will""embarrass Abbott over climate change"" - all the lefties were predicting a fractured meeting. LOL. ",45,TimOfAltona
5752,"The meeting went well with Obama saying along the lines ""he notes that Tony Abbott has a clear mandate from the Australian people when it comes to climate change measures"". ",31,TimOfAltona
5753,Good to see the Labor/Greens cheer squad all bitter and twisted over Abbott's successful North American visit - all they have left are grubby comments and personal shallow attacks. ,30,TimOfAltona
5754,Walking the political tight rope between Japan and China is never easy - although Abbott did a pretty good job on his last visit up there (certainly impressed the Americans I see) so Bishop does need to choose her words very carefully. Both Japan and China are essential to Australia's economic growth. So far so good on that front.,59,TimOfAltona
5755,"There is a reason why Tony Abbott is in this photo with Hugh Jackman and the Labor/Greens cheer squad look other way and don't want to hear it for fear it portrays Abbott in a positive light - Hugh's wife, Deborra-Lee Furness is patron of Australian Adoption Awareness and in December last year Tony Abbott cut the red tape to make it easier for Australian couples, or singles, to adopt children from overseas. Furness is a Tony Abbott fan for his efforts in this area. Hundreds of Australian couples will be able to adopt needy children from oveseas, primarily Ethiopia, Taiwan and South Korea as a result. Good news story.",110,TimOfAltona
5756,Worth looking at it - it seems to be working well in the US and supported by Obama. Particularly as it gives students from lower socio-economic and minority backgrounds a real opportunity to enter the middle class corporate world ,40,TimOfAltona
5757,"Blindly opposing it on the basis that it was the the PM visiting the school and labelling it innovative is short sighted and naive by the Labor/Greens supporters - but hey, what's new?",33,TimOfAltona
5758,I wonder if John McTernan was with Julia Gillard when she as PM went and had dinner with Rupert - and what about Kevin Rudd - who went with him when he as PM went and had dinner with Rupert?,40,TimOfAltona
5759,He has already stated he will run as an Independent - his chances of re-election? About as much chance as Craig Thomson had in regaining Dobell as an Independent. ,30,TimOfAltona
5760,The previous Labor government saddled the state and rate payers with a multi-billion dollar desal white elephant plant - which will take generations to pay off - if ever. It hit the blue collar voters in Frankston hard.,38,TimOfAltona
5761,I think many commentators have got themselves confused - certainly their comments indicate they are - Morrison is referring to the Iraqis who choose to return home voluntarily from Manus or Nauru - he is not proposing to force people to return to Iraq against their will - big difference between the two. ,54,TimOfAltona
5762,Hanson-Young is saying that we should stop people voluntarily returning home - strange. She wants them to be forced to stay in Australia despite them wanting to return home - everyday Sarah further alienates herself from the thinking of most Australians.,41,TimOfAltona
5763,"I cannot recall any Australian government, Labor or Liberal, take a strong position on West Papua despite damning evidence that gross human rights abuses, including militarily sanctioned murders, occur on a regular basis. ",34,TimOfAltona
5764,You miss the point - moving them to Christmas Island will put the people smugglers back into the frame - all of a sudden they have a product to sell once moreand the boats start arriving in their hundreds again. ,41,TimOfAltona
5765,I see Obama is sending in a couple of hundred US battle ready special forces into Iraq to bolster the protection US embassy personnel and the Baghdad embassy compound - what happens to the Australian embassy - do we send SAS in to protect or evacuate now? ,48,TimOfAltona
5766,Spot on - most likely around the end of the third term of this government - but could extend to the end of the fourth term if Labor can't get their act together over leadership and party direction.,38,TimOfAltona
5767,"Actually, Ed Husic scrubbed up pretty well on Q&amp;A last night - potential ALP leadership material - he is a former union official (CPEU and AWU) and that always goes down well in ALP leadership ballots. ",37,TimOfAltona
5768,He 'gets away with it' because it is what the journos and everyone else already know - Labor/Greens got us into this mess and the Coalition were voted in sort it out...nothing new there.,34,TimOfAltona
5769,"Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your beloved Julia Gillard had she survived the night of the Shorten 'Long Knives', would be in the exactly the same position she is now - out of government and awaiting her turn in a witness box at a Royal Commission into criminal union activity near you - perhaps the only difference would be Labor would be a further 20 seats down in the House of reps, such was the level of animosity and distrust Australians felt towards her. ",89,TimOfAltona
5770,You make it sound as if Australia is already at war in Iraq - perhaps our ground troops will be pushing north of Baghdad any day now - do keep us informed of what happens next in your delusional world of concocted and confected anti-government propaganda.,46,TimOfAltona
5771,Spot on - 99.999% of the world have no idea who Tony Abbott is and an even smaller number would have even heard of George Brandis or what he said. ,31,TimOfAltona
5772,"You read way too much into this - this is a storm in a teacup and once Bishop has spoken with the Arab countries and Indonesia this will all blow over faster than you can belt out a few lines of ""Solidarity Forever"". ",44,TimOfAltona
5773,Forget the electricity bills down here - what about our water bills after the ALP saddled the state with a multi-billion dollar white elephant desal plant that our great great great grand children will still be paying off in the next 150 years. ,44,TimOfAltona
5774,"No, that's an old LGCS* fable that was disproved - a few try to resurrect the accusation when it suits them - but it has no foundation at all. ",30,TimOfAltona
5775,The leadership instability down at team Labor continues unabated - this'll keep 'em out of government for at least another 2 terms. You would think Labor learnt their lesson from the Rudd/Gillard civil war years. ,36,TimOfAltona
5776,"If you follow the interview sequence, you will find Abbott is speaking about this only because reporters started questioning him on it - Abbott's presser was called to talk about the budget and carbon tax repeal, not Iraq and border protection.  ",43,TimOfAltona
5777,Your biggest problem will be Labor's ability to mount a credible alternative government challenge by then - I think we all know Labor's toughest times are still ahead of them while they try to rebuild from the Rudd/Gillard civil war years - 2016 is way too soon for Labor to be ready for anything IMHO.,55,TimOfAltona
5778,"Jim, why shouldn't they milk border protection for all it's worth - it is after all a victory of sorts and one of the key policies they went to and won the last election on. ",36,TimOfAltona
5779,"The 30 SAS are over there with the support of the government and Labor to assist in protecting the skeleton Australian embassy staff, the compound and any Australian citizens seeking shelter if things turn nasty in Baghdad - their primary mission is to assist in the safe evacuation of Australian's if the need arises. ",55,TimOfAltona
5780,"The conflict in northern/western Iraq is much broader than just Iraq - it has the potential to envelop the entire region - Jordan, Syria, Iran, Kuwait and so on - this has massive implications for the rest of the region and beyond. Burying your head in the sand and hoping it goes away won't solve this crisis.",57,TimOfAltona
5781,I would not read too much into the polls at this stage - mostly they will reflect badly on the government which is to be expected given the budget schmozzle &amp; the uncertainty in the new senate going on (C'mon Clive vote with the government - you know you want to). ,52,TimOfAltona
5782,"The ALP &amp; it's supporters can bask in a bit of poll sunshine for a while but make no mistake they will turn around and put the Coalition ahead in coming months as the government's policies bed down and Labor's internal woes, particularly over leadership and direction, intensify.",48,TimOfAltona
5783,Sometimes you just have to accept things as they are - embracing and salivating over polls that reflect badly on the Coalition one week and then rejecting/rubbishing the same poll a week later when it shows the Coalition coming back does your side no good in the credibility stakes. ,50,TimOfAltona
5784,"This is how polls work - there is no conspiracy going on here - it is what it is. Shooting the messenger when things go badly for you, whether that be a Guardian journalist or a particular opinion poll will not get your side back into government.",47,TimOfAltona
5785,Key and Obama played a 5 hour round of golf together in Hawaii last year - the only world leader to get quality time with Obama on the golf course. ,31,TimOfAltona
5786,Labor does not get a lot of things - half of them are still living in denial believing Tony Abbott and News Ltd are to blame for Labor's woes. ,30,TimOfAltona
5787,"Until they face up to the facts and rebuild the party by sorting out the leadership farce, the factional in-fighting and properly define their relationship with the Greens (are they inside or outside the tent?) the conservatives will remain in government in this country.",44,TimOfAltona
5788,"Back to this issue, Abbott was the opposition leader - he was being paid to oppose the sitting government to try and win government for the Coalition - it's what opposition parties do. It's what Shorten is doing now. ",40,TimOfAltona
5789,"No. I saw the Tele stuff - calling out a bad government for what it was - a bad government, racked by infighting and dysfunction. It's what the media do. If Labor were not so dysfunctional, they are certain to have received better press. ",45,TimOfAltona
5790,For months now we've been reading in these threads from the Labor cheer squad how Labor's demise was all down to News Ltd - nothing to do with dysfunction and disarray in the Labor party - oh no it's all Rupert's fault. ,43,TimOfAltona
5791,"Well, it's good to see Labor itself admitting that they were responsible for their own demise - let's hope the Labor cheer squad deniers all take note and stop this constant crap about News Ltd bringing down their government. ",40,TimOfAltona
5792,Australia's been doing it's fair share of the heavy lifting here and should be congratulated - this humanitarian work can continue in an orderly and responsible way now that the people smugglers operating out of Indonesia have been largely shut down by this government. ,45,TimOfAltona
5793,There is nothing untoward here - Australia has an obligation to protect it's own embassy and staff plus Australian aid workers etc who may shelter in the embassy compound if things deteriorate in Baghdad. ,35,TimOfAltona
5794,For all these initiatives to work it is important that as many stakeholders/constituents adopt through understanding how it works and also having access to the technology - particularly when it comes to social services such as Centrelink.  ,39,TimOfAltona
5795,"Melissa, I seem to recall that, for very good reason, it is illegal to publish images in the media that can identify individual asylum seekers - yet there is a very clear picture of an Iranian asylum seeker behind wire at the head of this piece? ",47,TimOfAltona
5796,Under what authority can an Australian minister conduct an inquiry into a police force of another country - particulaly when the police force is as you say supported/protected by the government of the other country. ,36,TimOfAltona
5797,Angus Campbell's biggest problem is that he is the military spokeperson for a very successful government policy - a policy the Coaliton took to the election and have subsequently delivered on. ,32,TimOfAltona
5798,"This issue alone smacks of another strong win for the coalition in 2016, so unfortunately for Campbell he will be targeted/attacked by the LGCS who so desperately wanted to see the boats keep departing Indonesia and arriving in Australia - for no other reason than to call Abbott a liar. ",51,TimOfAltona
5799,Well done Angus Campbell and well done Scott Morrison -. shutting down the people smugglers has saved potentially thousands of lives which would otherwise have been lost had Labor's asylum seeker amarda been allowed to continue.,36,TimOfAltona
5800,"Labor don't seem to get it - ranting, raving and abusing standing orders won't get them re-elected - Shorten needs to pull his team in line or risk further irrelevancy as leader.",32,TimOfAltona
5801,"The LGCS seem happy to keep borrowing, borrowing, borrowing to keep Labor's spending addiction alive - believing Wayne Swans fantasy predictions of budget surpluses under Labor are just around the corner. ",32,TimOfAltona
5802,Best we all start acknowledging that tough measures have to be implemented to get the economy and finances into a future proof state - which is why we voted in the Coalition to replace Labor's fiscal mismanagement of debt and deficit IMHO.,42,TimOfAltona
5803,"You are delusional - the people smugglers are making millions of dollars from their insidious trade - trying to portray them as some innocent, poor and harmless individuals who are 'saving' thousands of people is a load of crap. ",40,TimOfAltona
5804,The people smugglers have sent somewhere between 1 and 2 thousand people to their death by drowning in unseaworthy boats - how can you claim they are saving lives. ,30,TimOfAltona
