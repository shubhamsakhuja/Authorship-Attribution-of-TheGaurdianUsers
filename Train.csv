1,Wonder why this would not be covered under PNG law - last I looked Manus was part of another sovereign state. Presumably our friends down at Maurice Blackburn feel they have a better chance of getting money from the Australian government than the PNG government. Will be an interesting test case.,51,TimOfAltona
2,Interesting hypothesis - doubt there will be leadership change just yet - the election is a long way off - Abbott has some plenty of time on his side to turn the polling around and they will later in the year. ,42,TimOfAltona
3,Spot on - the only problem is that Abbott will not go to an early election - (would you with polling like this?) - plenty of time for the polls to turn around before the 2016 election and the second term of this government starts. IMHO.,46,TimOfAltona
4,To the contrary - the government have released a series of policies that involve belt tightening - which is why we see the left bleating about losing their halcyon days of rivers of borrowed money flowing through the economy artificially propping everyone up. ,44,TimOfAltona
5,The government was always going to take a hit from the socialist set when they went about the task of fixing up 6 years of Labor's fiscal ineptitude.  ,30,TimOfAltona
6,"If Shorten (providing he is still leader) thinks he can get away with spinning ALP rhetoric until about 5 o'clock on election eve 2016 before he releases any economic policies and hopes Labor will just fall over the line, he is mistaken. ",43,TimOfAltona
7,How would you address welfare reform? Keep borrowing money from overseas to keep throwing at it? Or would you perhaps explore ways of reforming whilst still protecting the genuinely weak members of the community? ,35,TimOfAltona
8,I suspect you may be a bit confused - this is not the government proposing changes - it is the head of an independent panel Patrick McClure advising of his findings. ,32,TimOfAltona
9,Now c'mon - who's kidding who here - she left her party with 7 seats in a 90 odd seat parliament - the best political leader our country has seen in a long time??????,34,TimOfAltona
10,"You could be a little confused or mis-informed - this is not a policy, it is an initial report on findings which are now open to the public for input then a final report with recommendations back to the government later this year.",43,TimOfAltona
11,"1. The government (Kevin Andrews) is not  recommending these measures - he is discussing some aspects of the independant report coming from Patrick McClure, Sally Sinclair and Wesley Aird (worth taking a look at who these people are) ",40,TimOfAltona
12,3. Public submissions relating to the report findings are open until August 08.Feedback from the public and organisations operating or impacted by the report findings are critical to forming a final report along with recommendations back to the government.  ,41,TimOfAltona
13,5. If people have valid or genuine concerns (other than you just don't like a Coalition government in power) then feel free to make your concerns known to the panel who are encouraging feedback to assist them with their final report back to government. ,45,TimOfAltona
14,Hopefully this takes some of the hysteria and misinformation out of the comments in this thread - there is a need to review the current system and the genuine faults that exist.,32,TimOfAltona
15,What sort of world do you live in? Let's get back to reality - of young people spend their welfare money on alcohol &amp; illegal drugs. In your world you think the government should continue to encourage alcohol and drug dependencies through welfare payments? ,47,TimOfAltona
16,My advice to you is firstly read the full report (link in the article) - you will find references to your situation - if you still have concerns or want to make a statement direct to the DSS you have until August 08 to make a submission. ,48,TimOfAltona
17,Feedback by way of public submissions will assist a final report and recommendations. You do have a voice on this particular issue - the authors of the discussion paper want to hear from people in your situation to assist them with a final report/recommendation. ,45,TimOfAltona
18,"If you take the time to read both the article and the report you will seethis sequence is underway - reacting to a head line without understanding the detail leads too many people, yourself included, into making a ""thought bubble"" comment devoid of fact.",44,TimOfAltona
19,The government should be taking a look at this - the report has identified areas where inefficiencies and disincentives to people working exist. Overall good to see the government exploring any improvements to the current system - what comes out of this remains to be seen. ,47,TimOfAltona
20,Let's hear what the ALP say about this - oh that's right - they support off shore processing as well and will endorse the government transferring these people to Manus or Nauru *Labor cheer squad go silent*,37,TimOfAltona
21,If they are that far from Christmas Island - assuming there is a boat in the first place - then Indonesia is the closest to steer their 'stricken' boat to safety - or are they waiting for the RAN taxi pickup service? ,43,TimOfAltona
22,If Rintoul is encouraging them to stay at sea to try and make it to Christmas Island then if something goes wrong he will have some serious explaining to do.,30,TimOfAltona
23,Bishop's stature in the international community has been growing and Australia's support for the new regime in Burma will help transition the country into a true democracy in time. Her meeting with the Rohingya community is also diplomatically significant and helps them get a voice internationally. ,47,TimOfAltona
24,"The problem with your argument is that if Australia treats children differently to adults, or more leniently then hey presto! hundreds of people smuggler boats laden with children will be departing Indonesian coast line headed for Australia. Then it's a numbers game as to how many make it and how many possibly perish at sea. ",56,TimOfAltona
25,"Exactly the same thing is happening in the US right now with tens of thousands of children entering the US from Central America, why? because the US, under Bush, provided for extra protection for children entering the US illegally...it has now got so out of hand that the Obama administration are about to repeal the legislation which provides automatic asylum for children and will start deporting them back to their country of origin, mainly Honduras and Nicaragua. ",78,TimOfAltona
26,"Perhaps Fairfax don't want their publications advertising rallies for far left organisations such as Socialist Alternative, Communist Party Australia, Get Up and the like who are behind these events you are trying to drum up support for. ",38,TimOfAltona
27,I'll sleep better tonight knowing that we have so many experts on Sri Lanka commenting in the Guardian thread - they all appear to have a far superior knowledge of the situation on the ground as it relates to Tamils than DFAT does. ,44,TimOfAltona
28,"By the way - these people on the boat, if they are Tamils, came from Southern India - Tamil Nadu - of which Chennai is the capital, the language is Tamil, population 72 million and has been home to the Tamil people since 1500 BC. ",46,TimOfAltona
29,Good to see Albrechtsen join the ABC selection panel. She has a wealth of journalism experience. Transparency is the key here and there is no reason to believe any board appointment decisions won't be made with the best interests of the ABC at the forefront. ,46,TimOfAltona
30,Tears them apart that this government has actually gone out and implemented a policy that has saved possibly thousands of lives from drowning at sea - you could be mistaken for thinking the left wanted the drownings that occurred under the last Labor/Greens government to continue just so they can point the finger of blame at the current government. ,60,TimOfAltona
31,Trying to portray these events as some kind of harmless fun filled family picnic day when they are in fact led by radical left wing organisations is deceiving people. ,30,TimOfAltona
32,"I think this is what Brandis is saying - it's the left wing Wikileaks campaigner cum lawyer, Greg Barnes who is saying we may not be able to detain people returning from fighting with outlawed terrorist groups in Iraq/Syria. ",40,TimOfAltona
33,"Fair dinkum - as soon as we have a major terrorist attack in Australia which kills and maims innocent people, all these left-wing do-gooders will all suddenly go silent and hope we don't remember that they were the ones who constantly frustrated the government's efforts to protect our borders.",49,TimOfAltona
34,Bottom line - the government is delivering on a pre-election promise and is shutting down the evil &amp; deadly people smuggling trade kick started by Kevin Rudd and Labor in 2007. ,32,TimOfAltona
35,Boats don't depart = people don't drown. Fairly simple equation lost on so many who advocate welcoming the ten of thousands who would otherwise attempt the journey by sea and paying millions to people smugglers along the way. ,39,TimOfAltona
36,"Clive Palmer survives from one stunt to the next - beneath all the bluff and bluster he will always support LNP over Labor , although he's convinced/conned a fair few of the Labor cheer squad that he's on their side and many have fallen for it hook line and sinker. ",51,TimOfAltona
37,"I have a brillaint solution - let's shut down the people smugglers, stop the boats departing Indonesia in the first place, empty out and close down the off shore processing centres (like before), process all those in onshore processing centres then shut them down too (like before) and then everyone wins! ",52,TimOfAltona
38,"No more overcrowded processing centres on or off shore, no more men women and children hopelessly drowning at sea, reduce Australia's debt by billions of dollars, have an orderly and controlled asylum migration program that welcomes and provides the support for genuine refugees through the UNHCR program and no more First Dog cartoons attacking the government with click bait cartoons on this issue! ",64,TimOfAltona
39,"Actually we are both right - true, it was initiated under the Howard government in 2002 and Australia committed to the first order of 14 aircraft under the Rudd Labor government of 2009.",33,TimOfAltona
40,Yes you are spot on. Australia did not have the ship building infrastructure to embark on such a massive project - the cost to establish the infrastructure would have blown out the cost of the project by billions for the same result in the end.,45,TimOfAltona
41,It was the Labor government who did the evaluation and placed the order for these - the incoming government simply fulfilled the order - it was all in the timing. ,31,TimOfAltona
42,"PS - the aircraft have had some teething issues, but are far superior to any other military aircraft in our region and will serve the nation well - good on Labor and the Coalition for the foresight to get this going.",41,TimOfAltona
43,I'm with you - the boats have all but stopped - let's clear out the off shore processing centres by either voluntary or forced repatriation to country of origin for the economic asylum seekers or relocating to a third country for resettlement for the genuine ones and do it as fast as possible so we return to the status quo of the Howard years (before Labor came along a mucked it up),72,TimOfAltona
44,"That's fine, but we need to ensure we have the infrastructure and support services to handle large numbers each year - no point in bringing these people in if they end up being consigned to some kind of migrant ghetto with everyone living off welfare, unemployed and no prospects to build a better life. ",55,TimOfAltona
45,"You only have to look at some suburbs in Paris, Athens, Frankfurt, Naples or London to see what happens when migration gets out of control - oh and for god's sake - don't encourage any increased intake to arrive by people smuggling boats.",43,TimOfAltona
46,"You don't understand - these boats leave Indonesia or Sri Lanka with plenty of people both at the departure point and arrival point (Australia) who know who is on board, when they left, when they should arrive and also have contact with the refugee advocates in Australia. If a boat simply disappears the alarm will be raised including through the media. ",62,TimOfAltona
47,"They are, but economic migrants should enter the country through the correct migration channels like thousands of others do - not pay people smugglers to illegally enter Australia by boats from Indonesia.",32,TimOfAltona
48,Suggest any Brits tuning in also read comments in some other Australian newspapers to learn that this small but vocal (in the Guardian at least) left wing mob are in the minority.,32,TimOfAltona
49,If you want to start submitting complete and utter nonsense better be prepared to back it up - let's have this list of technologies developed tens of thousands of years before European settlement. ,34,TimOfAltona
50,"Funny how many people would rather not be here at all and would rather see Australia in 2014 back to where it was pre-colonisation in the 1700's, inhabited only by hunting and gathering indigenous people. ",36,TimOfAltona
51,"Abbott was referring to the contribution Britain made to establishing infrastructure, trade and investment in Australia when they arrived in the 1700's. He was not having a go at the indigenous people.",32,TimOfAltona
52,It would be being a tad disingenuous to suggest that Australia had existing infrastructure and global trade before the Brits arrived in the 1700's - the only point Abbott is making.,31,TimOfAltona
53,If you don't like what the government has achieved by late 2016 you can go and cast your vote and if the government has not been good enough or lived up to expectations and the consensus by the majority of Australians is that Labor/Greens parties have their act together the government will change. ,54,TimOfAltona
54,"Can't see any problem with the point he is making - In the 17th &amp; 18th century Britain colonised and then built infrastructure and trade in many under developed countries which had an indigenous population, Australia and NZ included, as did the French, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish. ",48,TimOfAltona
55,Kind of balances the books in a funny sort of way because we in Australia had to endure John McTernan from UK Labour as the chief strategist trying to keep Labor's Australian PM Julia Gillard in power. He resorted to plenty of subterfuge to try and prop Gillard up.,49,TimOfAltona
56,"Ian, I respect your point of view but the fact remains you cannot have uncontrolled migration across borders, particularly maritime borders without suffering the same horrific consequences you see in Europe today. The Abbott government policies enjoy a fair amount of support from countries in Europe who are suffering the massive social and financial cost of uncontrolled borders and migration. ",61,TimOfAltona
57,"As you well know, Rudd dismantled Howard's border protection policy and as you well know the result was a massive surge of people trying to reach Australia with onshore detention centres popping up all over the country and then were bursting at the seams and all the problems, riots etc, associated with that. The boats kept coming and coming, Indonesian and Pakistani people smugglers were turning into millionaires, people were regularly drowning at sea and Labor's popularity hit rock bottom. ",81,TimOfAltona
58,"Are we all happy with how they have gone about it? No. But it is working. The incentive to try to reach Australia by boat has been largely removed, the offshore &amp; onshore detention centres will be closed down (as they were under Howard) and Australia can enjoy an orderly and controlled refugee intake program which welcomes and assimilates thousands of genuine refugees each year.",65,TimOfAltona
59,1. Those who were pissed off that the coalition used this topic to win the last election and desperately want the policy to fail- just so they can say Abbott deceived Australia. It tears them apart that the scoreboard looks like this - ,44,TimOfAltona
60,2. Those who actually agree that the government has done a great job in shutting down people smugglers and preventing deaths at sea but have to maintain a confected attack on the government in order to 'stay in the circle'of their fellow Labor/Greens cheer squadders ,46,TimOfAltona
61,3. The bitter and twisted 'I'm on a mission' group - those who have since 9pm Sept 7 last year constantly attacked the PM and the government on anything and everything that arises as 'payback' for their large election loss. This grouping are easy to identify. ,47,TimOfAltona
62,"4. Those who genuinely believe that Australia should open up our borders and welcome and financially support anyone and everyone who can make it here by any means and claim asylum, even if it means hundreds of thousands attempt the journey each year. All offshore processing stopped and everyone can freely enter the community on arrival. This group turns a blind eye when the inevitable deaths at sea occur and pretend they did not happen. Greens? ",77,TimOfAltona
63,5. Those who have  empathy (not a politically motivated one) for the plight of the asylum seekers who try to come here by boat and want/expect the government to treat them with compassion and dignity within the framework of the existing policy. ,44,TimOfAltona
64,"Please enlighten us as to who would be replacing the government - the hapless, directionless, leaderless ALP; the increasingly irrelevant Greens or perhaps you are a PUP supporter? Can't really see any of those three up to the job now or in 2.5 years time IMHO.",46,TimOfAltona
65,We have a generous asylum migration program in place allowing thousands of displaced people to start a new life in Australia by going through the correct channels and being welcomed by the Australian community. ,35,TimOfAltona
66,There is no truth to the rumour that the Senate dress code had to be amended to cater for some of the newly elected cross bench senators -  ,30,TimOfAltona
67,"Ian, this one has been thrashed over and over again for months - it is not illegal to seek asylum but it is illegal to enter Australia on people smuggling boats without visas or identification, hence they are detained in processing centers if they can make it here without drowning along the way. ",54,TimOfAltona
68,"No, those coming by illegal boats and did not drown along the way would have been sent to Manus or Nauru where they would have been processed and settled in a third safe country.  ",36,TimOfAltona
69,"These people did not set off from Sri Lanka - they set off from Southern India where there is no Tamil persecution. True, many Sri Lankan Tamils live in camps, but they are safe to go about their business and earn a living for themselves and their families. The Tamil governer of Tamil Nadu is moving towards granting all Sri Lankan Tamil refugees Indian citizenship. ",66,TimOfAltona
70,We should note that  person on that boat was assessed as having a case to apply for refugee status and was given the opportunity to stay with Australian authorities &amp; have their case processed in Nauru or Manus - that person elected to return to Sri Lanka. ,49,TimOfAltona
71,Makes you wonder what marketing material is being used by people smugglers to entice people onto these boats - refugee advocate Ian Rintoul seems to be across what's going on here given people from the boats are in contact with him while they are at sea. ,47,TimOfAltona
72,Good to see the government holding firm on it's resolve and commitment to maintain border security to deter people smuggling operations. The people on board went through the accepted screening process and have been returned to their country of origin. ,41,TimOfAltona
73,"Remember, these people departed the relatively prosperous Tamil state of Tamil Nadu in Southern India home to tens of millions of Tamils - one could easily reach the assumption they were heading to Australia not to escape persecution but for economic reasons. This aspect would have formed part of the screening process and the decision to return them to their homeland. ",62,TimOfAltona
74,The lefties just hate the thought the Coalition have been successful where Labor failed dismally particularly as it was a key election issue - and Morrison successfully did the job Labor were incapable of. ,35,TimOfAltona
75,"Not a bad summation at all Katharine - the ball is fairly and squarely in the government's court now to turn around the polls and public perception they have moved too quickly on fiscal reform and left reasonably large swarths of the community behind. They have plenty of time to achieve this, but need to be seen to be heading in this direction. ",64,TimOfAltona
76,"As for Labor, well as you say Bill can't believe his luck - here they were expecting to be in opposition for at least another term or two and suddenly he gets a sniff which will embolden him to try and start acting all statesman like. Can he pull it off? Unlikely - way too much ALP civil war baggage around his neck in my opinion. Labor will need to resolve their leadership conundrum, the perception they are tied to the bootlaces of the unions and their love/hate relationship with the Greens before they are ready to take back government. ",101,TimOfAltona
77,"So you would prefer our elected government does nothing - simply allows people to come and go as they please - this is no fear campaign, international terrorism is a constant threat.",32,TimOfAltona
78,"Shorten will never be a PM - you know it, I know it and pretty much the rest of Australia knows it - except maybe a few hopefuls down at the CFMEU.",32,TimOfAltona
79,This is one left wing journo's opinion - many people disagree with him and applaud the government's success in shutting down the people smuggling trade and saving countless lives along the way.,32,TimOfAltona
80,"By all accounts the Tamil tigers gave as good as they got and by some reports more - not defending the Sri Lankan government, but it was hardly a one-way street as you make out - atrocities and human rights abuses were committed by both sides.",46,TimOfAltona
81,"Sarah Hanson-Young - wants everyone who claims to seek asylum automatic entry - hell, the Greens will even charter a flotilla of luxury passenger liners to go to Indonesia and empty out all the camps and bring everyone back to Australia - that's who.",44,TimOfAltona
82,"Good to see Alan Jones still dominating Sydney airwaves. Like him or loath him, he does not hold back on his views and Sydney siders embrace him for it. ",30,TimOfAltona
83,"Yep, disagreed when he dumped Steve Bracks for the NY Consul General post last Sept - should have left Bracksy in the role, he would have done a fine job. ",31,TimOfAltona
84,"Also, disagree when he and other ministers use the term 'mandate'. That word is sure to rile anyone opposed to the policy and is easily shot down in flames. No government has a mandate on anything unless there is a referendum held on a particular issue. ",47,TimOfAltona
85,Funny thing about all this is had Muir gone the other way on Arena they would be attacking him with grubby and offensive remarks not unlike the ones they bestow on the PM. ,34,TimOfAltona
86,"In the greatest traditions of Australian Labor, where Julia Gillard was not allowed to speak unless John McTernan pre-scripted her - who is scripting Muir? He sure as hell ain't coming up with this stuff all by himself. ",39,TimOfAltona
87,They use any platform to throw confected punches at the PM and government - they are all desperately trying to link Tony Abbott to Japan's atrocities during WWII - fail.,30,TimOfAltona
88,Mock professor Sloan at your leftist peril. I put it to you she knows a tad more about economic matters than your good self - your problem is she is not on 'your side' so you endeavor to take her down in the finest traditions of the Labor/Greens cheer squad.,50,TimOfAltona
89,"Your point is valid, however there is another very sad side to this equation which is overlooked - how about start posting the photographs of the hundreds of 'Ferminas' who have drowned at sea coming to Australia on people smuggler boats? ",42,TimOfAltona
90," Where are the cries of 'never again will we allow men, women and children to die at sea in their hundreds whilst travelling to Australia in people smuggler boats'? ",31,TimOfAltona
91,The Greens and the lefties using this topic to try and land blows on the government need to take a good look at themselves and at least acknowledge that the government's policies have saved possibly countless lives.,37,TimOfAltona
92,That has to be one of the worst pieces of journalism we've seen in recent times -I bet Andrew Street mulled over whether or not to include such a weak attempt at humour into the narrative or not - unfortunately for him he included it.,45,TimOfAltona
93,Can't understand why the cheer squad are fawning all over him - as though he is the great messiah who can land blows on the Abbott government on their behalf?  ,32,TimOfAltona
94,Clive can enjoy his 5 minutes of soaking up the adulation from an adoring Labor/Greens cheer squad but a word of warning Clive - as soon as you revert to your conservative roots and herd your cabal of senators into the blue corner the Labor/Greens supporters will start tearing you apart in these threads...it won't be a pretty sight.,59,TimOfAltona
95,"Longers, I deeply respect your views and compassion when it comes to Australian diggers and the atrocities they experienced at the hands of the Japanese in WWII - my father fought the Japanese advance whilst serving as an officer with the 10th Ghurka Rifles in the jungles of Burma and I assure you I can well relate to some of the horror stories coming out of that period - but mate, it was a long time ago and the world really has moved on - using Abe's visit to Australia as a platform to knock Abbott over Japan in WWII is drawing a very long bow - Abbott has said no more or no less than any other Australian PM, Labor or Liberal since the end of the war - Abe's grandfather was Japan's PM after the war and was warmly welcomed in Australia even back then. I think in 2014 it is well and truly time to move on.",160,TimOfAltona
96,"Bit rich coming from a person who will never be a Foreign Affairs minister to person who is a serving Foreign Affairs minister - with the greatest of respect to Ms Plibersek, she knows stuff all about international politics and relationships. ",42,TimOfAltona
97,"Let the Labor/Greens cheer squad enjoy the moment, but this charade will all end in tears for Clive and his PUP puppet senators - what's the betting the senators are around longer in politics than Clive?",36,TimOfAltona
98,Any genuine asylum seekers ie fleeing persecution or worse (hard to imagine given they came from Tamil Nadu) can go to Manus or Nauru for processing and resettlement in a third country or voluntarily return to their prosperous Tamil state in India. ,43,TimOfAltona
99,I read recently that the Tamil governer of Tamil Nadu is moving towards granting Indian citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils relocating to Southern India - this gives them the same rights for them and their families to work and ability to start businesses etc.,44,TimOfAltona
100,Your point about bias against the Japanese is valid - probably because the Scandinavian countries don't hunt and kill their whales in or near Australian waters - out of sight out of mind so to speak.,36,TimOfAltona
101,Time to finally accept that your side has lost this debate. Australians are backing Morrison and his achievements in shutting down the people smugglers and stopping drownings in their tracks. ,31,TimOfAltona
102,"Tough for you I know, but rest assured that the off shore detention centres will one day be empty and shut down - Christmas Island as well - as much as that disturbs you to see a major government win, it is a good thing for everyone involved. ",49,TimOfAltona
103,The Global Times do not represent the views of the Chinese government cheer squadders - it is a column by a journalist from this chinese media outlet expressing his opinion. The Global Times write critical stories about many governments around the world including in the past the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd debacles. ,50,TimOfAltona
104,Good to see the Coalition and PUP look like finally getting this carbon tax repealed whilst putting the Labor/Greens senate team back in their kennels where they deservedly belong. ,30,TimOfAltona
105,Valid observation - but my contention is that had Murdoch backed Gillard &amp;/or Rudd ot let's just say the ALP over the Coalition and irrespective of the election outcome these threads about Murdoch would be almost void of any criticism or the swarth of grubby remarks you see in here today. ,52,TimOfAltona
106,Murdoch was not responsible for the ALP losing last September - nor was Tony Abbott - Labor themselves were to blame as per the findings of the recent ALP internal review of last year's defeat. ,36,TimOfAltona
107,"I agree, we only want media owned/controlled by left wing organisations in this country - that way we can all enjoy a few rousing bars of while we munch on our morning weetbix whilst looking up at the mandatory portrait of the ALP leader on the kitchen wall. ",49,TimOfAltona
108,But seriously - it matters not who owns Australian media - they will still call out a bad government when it is a bad government - and at any examination the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd governments were hopelessly dysfunctional and the ALP paid the price.,42,TimOfAltona
109,He's spot on about the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd civil wars government - all Australia knows it was a dysfunctional rabble during those years (with a few exceptions) and was deservedly shown the door to opposition where they shall remain for at least another 2 terms. ,44,TimOfAltona
110,The sooner the Labor/Greens cheer squad acknowledge they were backing the wrong horse and move on to try and rebuild their shattered parties the better off they and their respective parties will be.,33,TimOfAltona
111,Of course the Labor/Greens cheer squad will attack anything to do with Murdoch - for he did not back their team last year when they lost in spectacular fashion. ,30,TimOfAltona
112,Bottom line here is that Campbell is leading an operation that has successfully shut down the insidious people smuggling trade perhaps saving hundreds or thousands of souls from drowning. Campbell enjoys the support of millions of Australians. ,38,TimOfAltona
113,Can't for the life of me understand why the Labor/Greens supporters denounce that - I don't for a moment think they would rather see people drowning at sea - but I would like just one of them to explain how else do you stop people drowning at sea in people smuggler boats apart from stopping the boats leaving in the first place? ,63,TimOfAltona
114,Here I was thinking 'Centreline' would be the first cheer squadder to admit that lives have been saved - but no - can't bring himself to do it - that would look too much like acknowledging the success of the government and that would  do in a Guardian thread.,50,TimOfAltona
115,He has done an excellent job in shutting down the people smugglers and saving countless lives - a pity he was not around when people were drowning in their hundreds after the Rudd Labor government started up the people smuggling trade again and carried on under the Gillard Labor/Greens government. ,51,TimOfAltona
116,"I know many left wing supporters don't like to see the success of Operation Sovereign Borders but I live for the day when  of the cheer squad admit that maybe, just maybe lives have been saved since boats stopped departing Indonesia and that is wholly a good thing. ",50,TimOfAltona
117,"33,000 feet in the air is hardly in a war zone and dozens of commercial planes follow the same flight path between Asia and Europe each day. Who would have guessed the Russians had handed over sophisticated surface to air missiles to allow the separatists to shoot down planes? ",50,TimOfAltona
118,Grubby personal comments aimed at a person's appearance means you instantly lose the argument. It means you have nothing left in your locker except personal abuse. Sums up many of the Labor/Greens cheer squad unfortunately.,35,TimOfAltona
119,The stupidity of all this is it is the left wing refugee advocates who are prolonging the wait at sea for these peole while they try to force through the High Court for Australia to take them. ,38,TimOfAltona
120,These people would be far better off returning to the freedom of Tamil Nadu than being forced to go into the off shore detention centres that the Greens seem intent on sending them to.,34,TimOfAltona
121,I see that Tamil Governer Rosahiah of this state is working on giving Sri Lankan Tamil refugees Indian citizenship to assist with their integration with the 70 odd million Tamil speaking citizens of this prosperous Indian state.,37,TimOfAltona
122,Why is it that the Labor opposition constantly undermines the government at every possible opportunity? They may have different ideas but this is unprofessional behaviour that would be unacceptable in any other workplace. ,34,TimOfAltona
123,LOL - the Australian Labor/Greens cheer squad desperately concerned the PM will come out of this with an enhanced global reputation and he and Bishop may actually be credited with bringing our dead home - sleepless nights ahead for the cheer squad as they grapple with this awkward situation they find themselves in. ,54,TimOfAltona
124,Abbott and Bishop are doing what we expect the Australian government do - it may irk the Labor/Greens cheer squad that they are making progress &amp; receiving recognition on the world stage - but bottom line is we want the dead home and we want them home now. ,49,TimOfAltona
125,For the people not from Australia reading this blog 'Yamba' is part of a group called the Labor/Greens cheer squad who infect the Guardian threads with grubby comments against the Australian government as payback for the devastating loss their political party experienced last year - nearly wiped out - so this is part of their campaign of vilification and retribution. ,61,TimOfAltona
126,The government can safely adopt the Hockey sponsored productivity report final recommendations once they come out later this year which will probably see a watering down of the paid parental scheme and funds channelled into early childhood reform. ,39,TimOfAltona
127,Sussan Ley is a class operator and correct when she says this is a once in a generation opportunity for reform. I would expect the government to adopt most if not all of the final recommendations later this year. ,40,TimOfAltona
128,A good friend friend of mine who lives in QLD tells me Newman has tried to do too much too quickly - changing the world overnight and he has managed to leave some people behind with some decisions. I suspect he will slow down the pace of change to better reflect community expectations. ,54,TimOfAltona
129,Time for the Labor/Greens cheer squad to take stock of their crass insensitivity to people dying and being killed just so they can try and land confected blows against the government. ,32,TimOfAltona
130,Read some of the posts from your mob in this thread attacking Abbott for doing the job he should as PM over this tragedy and then come back to us with an apology.,33,TimOfAltona
131,Good to see Abbott taking a world leadership position on pressuring Russia to allow access to the crash site. Abbott and Bishop are leading the charge on behalf of the relatives of the murdered Australians as well as all the other nationalities - exactly what we expect of our PM. ,51,TimOfAltona
132,"Can't see that happening myself, still over 2 years to go before the next election and plenty of time for the polls to turn around which they undoubtedly will as Abbott's policies gain traction and Labor's mismanagement of our economy is reversed by the new government. ",47,TimOfAltona
133,"What a load of crap. Your greatest fear is that Abbott gets the recognition he deserves for doing all he can to bring the dead Australians' home - you put your cheap political point scoring ahead of the deaths of Australian men, women and children and the grieving of their relatives.

144,The current group on board the customs vessel did not have a man with a gun at their head when they departed for Australia. They came from the relatively prosperous Tamil state in Southern India. They were not escaping fearing for their lives or escaping persecution - 70 million people live happily in Tamil Naidu... they were coming to Australia hoping to tap into our welfare system and perhaps get a job and perhaps give their families a better head start in life - there are tens of millions queued up behind them wanting to do the same thing.,99,TimOfAltona

146,"Yes - people smugglers do exist in the  world and yes, people hoping to bypass the UNHCR program and get to Australia by illegal boat do pay people smugglers for the service. ",34,TimOfAltona
147,"The people 'crewing' the boats are not the people smugglers - they are being paid by the people smugglers to do the job - the people smugglers have made millions of dollars and a % of this goes to the corrupt police, military and assorted Indonesian government officials who are also on the payroll to facilitate the safe departure of the boats from Indonesia. ",65,TimOfAltona
148,"Also, many of the people paying people smugglers are not genuine asylum seekers - they are economic migrants looking to tap into Australia's welfare system and with any luck get a job here. ",34,TimOfAltona
149,"You pretty much have to go back to the Labor government under Kevin Rudd that opened up our borders and got the people smuggling industry back on it's feet. Tens of thousands of people climbed into people smuggler boats and headed for Australia, many hundreds drowning along the way. ",50,TimOfAltona
150,"The new government came in to fix up Labor's mess and is making good progress - the ultimate aim is to close down all processing centres, on and off shore. This will be achieved by stopping the boats - so far so good on that front - much to the annoyance of the Labor cheer squad who wanted the boats to keep arriving just so they could come into the Guardian threads and proclaim yet another Abbott promise broken. Good to see that little piece of enjoyment has been denied. ",91,TimOfAltona
151,Thank you Longers - at last a Labor supporter who acknowledges that the government is doing the right thing in it's efforts to bring our dead home to their families. ,31,TimOfAltona
152,"Pretty much all the other's are attacking Abbott and Bishop with confected abuse over the handling and response to the tragedy. I guess their key issue is that they want it to be a  PM doing all this, not a Liberal and they can't bring themselves to acknowledge that Abbott and co have done a bloody good job so far in doing everything we can to help the families and bring their deceased loved ones home. ",78,TimOfAltona
153,"Funny thing is though, you have to stop the boats to achieve that - otherwise, as we saw under Labor, the detention centres keep on filling up, even having to open up new ones to cope with the thousands arriving by boat each month. ",45,TimOfAltona
154,"Now come clean with the Australian people Crowey - you know as well as all of us here that had Abbott left the country to attend a meeting in Palau, you and the rest of the cheer squad would be up in arms attacking him for running away and leaving the the families of the victims of MH17. ",59,TimOfAltona
155,"Best to give up on your attacks over Abbott and MH17 - he is doing what we expect the Australian PM, Labor or Liberal, to be doing and that is firstly - doing everything humanly possible to help the families &amp; to bring their loved ones home and secondly doing all the Australian government can to to assist in bringing the perpetrators to justice. ",65,TimOfAltona
156,Some events transcend domestic politics and this is one of them - follow the lead of your Labor party who have thrown their weight behind Abbott to help him get this job done.,33,TimOfAltona
157,"I think the Labor supporters give Murdoch way too much credit - whilst he was a useful distraction for them away from their internal disunity and dysfunction - I suspect he holds little if any sway over Australian domestic politics. Ask former PM's Rudd and Gillard, they 'consulted' with Murdoch over dinners and lunches whenever they were in NY - I doubt they would support the conspiracy theorists active in these threads today (aka Labor cheer squad) that Murdoch influenced them one way or the other. ",87,TimOfAltona
158,"Who cares if Abbott discussed the PPL with Murdoch over dinner, he probably discussed a lot of things going on at the time - the PPL scheme was on Abbott's radar years before any dinner with Murdoch - it was out in the public domain back in 2010.",48,TimOfAltona
159,"They all beat a path to Murdoch's door when they to NY- Hawke, Howard, Rudd, Gillard, Abbott all have lunches and dinners with the News Corp chairman. Shorten will be working his way to meeting him as soon as he can swing it - if he holds onto the leadership that is.",52,TimOfAltona
160,The truth can be hurtful at times...we have all been there. Don't give up though - there  a place for Labor - it's just that this is not the time.,31,TimOfAltona
161,"Most are living in denial that Murdoch was calling a bad government for what it was, a bad government. At any examination the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years were not the best for Labor - dysfunction, back stabbing and leaks were a daily occurrence. ",42,TimOfAltona
162,Even the ALP's internal report on last year's election failure stated it was down to internal dysfunction fueled by intense and very public rivalry between the Gillard and Rudd camps. ,31,TimOfAltona
163,"The ALP's current leader, Shorten, was a key player/contributor to all the unfolding dramas and has, thanks to the unions, been rewarded with a temporary seat at the head of the table. He will not survive in that role if Labor is to have any chance of forming a government in the years ahead. ",55,TimOfAltona

170,But Ian herein lies the problem for Labor - Labor PMs and leaders are seen to be mere puppets for the strongest unions - Gillard is an excellent example. ,30,TimOfAltona
171,Unions are not as relevant to the Australian way of life as they were say 50 or even 30 years ago - in fact unions only represent a small % of the working population. ,35,TimOfAltona
172,This brings into question the whole relevancy of Labor as a political party and we end up with the infighting and back stabbing of the past 6 years - factions fighting for territory for a piece of a rapidly shrinking pie. ,42,TimOfAltona
173,"Shorten is trying his best to reignite the ""Light on the Hill' rhetoric - but this will fall largely on deaf ears - Australia has moved on from all that working class romanticism crap largely because so many more of us are much better off than we were 20 or 30 years ago. ",54,TimOfAltona
174,"Shame the cheer squad can't throw their support behind Abbott and Bishop's efforts to bring our dead Australians home to their families - in fact they are outright criticising them for doing what we expect them to be doing and achieving. From what I see and hear, the PM is being praised around the globe for his leadership achievements after the tragedy. ",63,TimOfAltona
175,Abbott has been surviving off minimal sleep since the MH17 disaster - he has been working during different time zones to discuss/coordinate the situation with various world leaders and our team on the ground - typically Europe between 2 and 4 in the morning and then going on to do a full days work. You choose to comment on his eyes as 'evil'. Try tired comrade.,66,TimOfAltona
176, is why Labor are out of office for the next 2-3 terms - the disconnect from reality blinds their judgement to the point that they live in a parallel universe from mainstream Australia.,34,TimOfAltona

181,HaHaHaHaHa Daisy - that is so coming from a long time member of the Labor/Greens cheer squad who between them spend hours on the Guardian threads each day writing hundreds of grubby and vilifying comments about Tony Abbott. ,39,TimOfAltona
182,"Exactly - I have been saying this for some time but keep on being shot down in flames by the Labor cheer squad....seriously, if Labor are to have any hope of forming government over the next 6-9 years they need to refocus on reform - Labor and their supporters banging on about the evil Tony Abbott &amp; hoping that will be enough to get them over the line is pure delusion and will ensure they stay in opposition for years to come.",82,TimOfAltona

192,The left are on the wrong side of public opinion on this one and lost the argument a long time ago...this government is to be congratulated for delivering on what they promised and what we voted for last September. Labor were just not up to the task...how many PM's did they go through and how many Immigration ministers did Labor churn through - was it 5 or 6? None of them up to the task - all failures. ,79,TimOfAltona

It is the right thing to do to bring them ashore temporarily until the High Court judgement is handed down and then they can either be returned to Tamil southern India or over to Manus or Nauru for processing. It is fairly likely these are economic migrants simply looking to improve their lives in Australia so either they return to India or their original homeland. Those determined to be  refugees can be resettled in a third country such as PNG, Nauru or Cambodia. ",101,TimOfAltona
198,You seem to be confused .the police are there for security dutiescrash investigators and forensic teams will be doing the work on the wreckage and human remains. The police are there because it would be too problematic for ADF or any troops from any country to be on the ground in that situation. ,54,TimOfAltona
199,Julie Bishop and her Dutch counterpart are making good progress in Kiev to bring this about with Ukrainian authorities whilst Abbott is dealing with Putin on the Russian side to allow unrestricted access for the multi-national police contingent to provide security whilst the forensic and recovery teams do their vital work. ,52,TimOfAltona
200,"Correct, the same occurred in 9/11. The key to this is forensic examination of the various crash sites to occur as quickly as possible before too much evidence or remains are lost...hence the government pushing for a security team to assist with this process.",44,TimOfAltona

213,What a load of crap - Gillard was the most detested PM in a generation - had she gone on to lead Labor to the election they would have been lucky to come away with 30 seats in the lower house - such was the feeling of animosity towards her - not only from mainstream Australia but within her own party. The only reason her and Combet were bosom buddies was because they were both marionettes for the powerful unions who dictated ALP policy through the PM placed into office.. ,91,TimOfAltona
214,The 'Gillard' experiment crashed and burned for Labor and they will never ever repeat that mistakenot if they ever want to return to government in this country. Gillard was a disaster - nearly destroyed her own party.,37,TimOfAltona

224, the polls have transformed from being highly dubious and a totally unreliable tool of a giant media conspiracy against Labor into a highly credible and accurate source of how voters feel about the government. ,36,TimOfAltona
225,Don't worry about that comment - it's the Labor/greens cheer squad worried that the PM may look good for what he's done following the tragedy - they can't stand the thought that he may actually have made a major contribution to bringing our dead home and will receive praise for it - none the least from the relatives of those tragically killed.,62,TimOfAltona

834,Those nice people at the Parliamentary Library no doubt have a great book collection. But why the Greens are getting their economic advice from the Library is a little odd.  ,30,TheJediMaster

836,Well Daisy if you won't believe Treasury documents - the national report card on fiscal matters - then it's a bit hard to have a chat with you about the budget. Night.,32,TheJediMaster
837,One small problem with your argument - the budget numbers show the deficit peaked under Swan in 2013-14 and is reducing. See table 1 - revenue and expenditure over 45 years.,31,TheJediMaster
838,"Have a look at the details. It was based on Labor's PEEFO in August 2013 and Abbott's first MYEFO in November 2013. It's pretty silly to use that example Daisy, it was badly flawed.",34,TheJediMaster
839,Some of those unions must be very confused with Labor and their CFMEU focus. The Shoppies for example who lean more to the centre than the left must be flabbergasted by the influence that the the hard core have. Can't say Shorten has managed it well at all.,48,TheJediMaster

843,"The lesson Shorten needs to learn here is simple - don't oppose a building industry watch dog. If Labor hadn't shut down the ABCC, for reasons so obvious to most of us, there wouldn't have been a need for TURC.",40,TheJediMaster
844,"Oh well. Besides the fact that TURC will save taxpayers billions by cleaning up the building industry. And let's face it, the $300 billion in debt left by RGR was the high water mark in waste.",36,TheJediMaster
845,"Maybe they will. Yes it does seem odd dumping this late on a Friday night, but let's face it, everything TURC does gets criticised relentlessly by Shorten and the unions. You'd almost think they have something to hide ....",39,TheJediMaster
846,"Yep, a few bad employers too. But TURC has predominantly exposed the union shams, potentially billions of dollars worth of them. The $80m price tag is a small price to pay to clean up this blight on our economic and industrial relations landscape. ",43,TheJediMaster

851,"It should be under majority national control, especially as it's a critical and strategic piece of infrastructure. It's also a supply chain monopolist through which much Northern Territory agriculture flows.",30,TheJediMaster
852,Yes remember all the criticism. People laughed when Abbott said he'd stop the boats. They laughed when he said he'd turn them back. They laughed when he said he'd sell the boats. ,32,TheJediMaster
853,"Yes, the carbon tax worked to reduce emissions. It also worked to reduce our standard of living, unemployment went up a full 1%, exporters lost contracts. There's a very good reason why no other country on earth put in something so punitive.  ",42,TheJediMaster

874,The thing that strikes me about Paris next week is that there's no key objective. There's no headline goal (e.g. 30% ERT by 2030) that is being worked towards. Have a look at their website: ,35,TheJediMaster
875,"Sure it raises a bit of revenue in the short term. But it decreases growth in the economy, which reduces government revenues. (we didn't run surpluses during the carbon tax years you might have noted). ",35,TheJediMaster
876,"But that's yesterday's debate. Today with Bill putting a 45% ERT and 50% RET on the table, he's got to put some numbers against it. And if Bill won't do the maths, then the media and government should.  ",38,TheJediMaster
877,"$600 billion over 15 years is the only starting point we have for the RET prediction alone. If people don't like that number, they should tell us why it's wrong.",30,TheJediMaster

889,The budget debate in Australia seems to go around in circles. Everyone knows we need to get back to surplus but nobody wants to accept less spending or more tax.  ,30,TheJediMaster
890,"Every government proposal seems to attract cries of""inequity"" the moment it's announced. But the budget is badly broken and unless we want to pass a massive debt over to our children, we better start paying our way.",37,TheJediMaster
